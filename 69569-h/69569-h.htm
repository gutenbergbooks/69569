<h3>SOME PRETTY PICTURES.</h3>


<p>“Oh, mamma, I have had a lovely time
at Mrs. Van Bibber’s! I would not have
missed her reception for the world!”</p>

<p>The blonde beauty threw herself, with
a silken frou-frou of rich attire, back
into a luxurious chair, clasped her white,
jeweled hands, and rolled her large, bluebell
eyes heavenward, practising the
seraphic expression she found so effective
with the men.</p>

<p>She repeated, rapturously:</p>

<p>“I would not have missed it for the
world! Everything was on the grandest
scale, and went off beautifully. I felt
that it was worth all our scheming and
planning for my lovely gown;” and she
smiled, complacently, at her rich blue
silk robe loaded with fine lace trimmings
that set off so well her blue eyes and
fluffy flaxen hair.</p>

<p>“But, mamma,” she continued, “how
sober you look. Is your rheumatism
worse, poor dear?”</p>

<p>The faded, elderly woman, with the
careworn face and fretful mouth, clasped
her thin, white hands nervously over her
knee and answered, wearily:</p>

<p>“My rheumatism is bad enough, but
what worries me most is that I made
such a mistake—pawning my diamonds
for that splendid gown when you might
have done better remaining at home
without it!”</p>

<p>“Mamma, what can you mean?” and
Jessie Stirling frowned, impatiently,
tearing a white rose to pieces with excited
fingers.</p>

<p>“I mean that, after all my sacrifices
to get you ready for Mrs. Van Bibber’s
reception, hoping you might meet Chester
Olyphant there and make up your
quarrel, he came here to call on you in
your absence.”</p>

<p>“And I missed him like that! Oh,
what a shame! But who could have
dreamed he would miss the reception?
Still, mamma, you should have kept him
till I returned. Oh, why did you let him
get away?” queried the girl, angrily.</p>

<p>“How could I help it, my dear? You
know very well I would have been willing
to chain him to his chair to keep
him here till you came! I did my best—made
talk, and tried to hold him, but
after an hour he pleaded an engagement
and hurried away.”</p>

<p>“But he will come again. Surely he
will! Of course you asked—made him
promise?” cried Jessie, wildly.</p>

<p>“Yes, oh yes, but he did not say he
would. He only came, he said, to return
some negatives you loaned him to make
pictures from—the ones you took with
your own camera in the mountains last
summer.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I remember—Uncle Hermann’s
picturesque old stone mansion,
and some mountains and river views
taken from the bridge at Alderson.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and some pictures, too, of that
hoidenish girl, Leola. I wish you had
left those out, Jessie.”</p>

<p>“Why, really, mamma, I forgot they
were in the negative book, for I didn’t
mean to show them to Chester. Not that
I could be jealous of a wild thing like
Leola Mead, but because I promised her
no one should see them. There was that
one of her wading in the creek, you
know, and another in bloomers sitting
astride her white pony Rex, and another
in hunting costume, rifle on her shoulder.
Really, she wasn’t pretty in any of the
negatives, except her white evening gown
with the lilies on her shoulder.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he said that was lovely, and the
others, too, and he asked no end of questions
about her, and where she lived. He
pretended to be anxious to see the scenery,
but I guess it was Leola more than
anything else. Men are so sly!”</p>

<p>“And you, mamma, what did you tell
him?” Jessie asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, I told him we should be glad to
have him visit Wheatlands some time
when we were there with my half brother,
but I made up my mind he should
never go there till you were safely his
wife.”</p>

<p>“Good, mamma, though, really, I cannot
look upon Leola Mead seriously as a
rival. Why, she is only a simple country
girl, with no style or good clothes at
all.”</p>

<p>“But dangerously pretty, Jessie, don’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
forget that!—and as for style, well, she is
graceful and dashing as any girl I ever
saw, and there’s no telling what might
happen if they met. Anyhow, he just
plied me with eager questions about the
girl, and I could see he was almost
fascinated by her pictures. Of course I
did not encourage him any. I said she
was my half brother’s ward, and presumably
of low origin, as he was reticent
about her birth, and said she had not a
friend in the world but himself. I enlarged
on her rude manners and hoidenish
ways, and said she was not nearly as
pretty as the pictures.”</p>

<p>“When in reality she is ten times prettier,”
laughed Jessie. “So you are right.
He must never see Leola Mead until I
am his wife. I shall write him a sweet
little note pretending he has lost one of
the negatives, and ask him to call
again.”</p>

<p>“I do not believe he will, for he evaded
the question when I urged him to do so.
Indeed, I even hinted how sorry you
were over the quarrel, and he said, quite
amiably, that it was all past now and he
hoped you and he might be good friends
again.”</p>

<p>“Friends, bah, he shall be my husband
yet! I will win him back again; his millions
shall not slip through my fingers
this time, I promise you, mamma, and
woe to any girl that dares try to rival
me! But, really, I am not jealous of
anybody, for I think I see his little
game. He wants to make up, or he
would not have come. It was easy
enough to return the pictures by mail,
now, wasn’t it? But he probably came
because he wanted to see me, and that
chat about Leola was only to make me
uneasy and jealous, don’t you see?”</p>

<p>“I hope so, dear, but really I was quite
frightened the way he talked of the
lovely pictures he had made from the
negatives.”</p>

<p>“Lovely nonsense!” Jessie cried, sharply,
with an angry gleam of her blue
eyes, and a vicious snap of her white
teeth as she added: “I believe I would
try to murder Leola if she came between
us, for I cannot believe his love for me
is dead so soon. If it is, I’ll soon warm
over the old coals again. I’ll write him
a note right away, saying how sorry I
am that I was out this afternoon, and
asking him to come this evening or to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Pray do so,” cried the scheming
mother, whose small means were dwindling
away so fast in the effort to keep
afloat in fashionable society till her
daughter’s beauty won a rich husband.</p>

<p>Jessie wrote and dispatched her pleading
note before she removed the dainty
hat from her fluffy blonde hair, and
when evening came she was waiting for
him, gowned in dainty white, befitting
the warm June weather.</p>

<p>To her amazement and anger there
was no reply, and the next morning she
read, in the society columns of her favorite
daily, that Chester Olyphant had
left New York the previous evening on
a yachting trip with several other young
men, and would be absent two weeks.</p>

<p>“Well, thank Heaven, there are only
men in the party, so he will not be exposed
to any other girl’s fascinations on
the trip, and I’ll be waiting for him
when he comes back,” cried Jessie,
swallowing her chagrin the best she
could.</p>

<h3>ALL FOR LOVE.</h3>


<p>Leola Mead sprang to the back of her
mettlesome pony and almost flew down
the mountain road, her great, dark eyes
flashing with anger, her cheeks glowing
crimson, her wealth of golden locks
streaming like a ruddy banner on the
breeze. Against the tight bodice of her
riding habit her young bosom heaved
tumultuously with the angry throbs of
her heart, for Leola had just had a bitter
quarrel with her guardian, and now
gave vent to her excitement by giving
free rein to Rex in a breakneck ride.</p>

<p>It was a lovely June morning in the
mountains of West Virginia, all Nature
at her sweetest and fairest, and Leola
had been planning such a happy, happy
day; but when she came out from breakfast
ready for her morning canter, there
stood her saturnine old guardian asking
her to step into the library for a moment
before she rode away.</p>

<p>Leola obeyed him, pouting, for she
hated to lose time indoors this gladsome,
golden day.</p>

<p>There was no love lost between her
and her grim guardian, anyway, for he
was a stern old man, reticent and mysterious,
spending most of his time in a
horrid laboratory up in the tower chamber
of the rough old stone house, where
the country folk said he was working
either to wrest from Nature the secret of
making gold, or the still greater mystery
of distilling a magic elixir of life.
About the neighborhood he got the sobriquet
Wizard Hermann, and looked the
character with his lean, stooping form,
long black hair floating over his coat collar,
strongly marked features and cunning
mouth, while his keen, gray eyes,
under bushy brows, seemed to pierce
one through with their questioning gaze.</p>

<p>His ancestors had been pioneer Indian
fighters, and the large house built of
rough stone, just as taken from the quarry,
dated back to the time when the red
man roamed the almost unbroken forest.</p>

<p>In all the years while Leola had lived
here with her governess in the lonely
old house, she could not remember a
caress from the mysterious, self-absorbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
old man, who seemed to have no
human interests or passions, and to care
for no one but the dwarfish servitor who
helped him in his laboratory, the only
person he ever admitted within its precincts.</p>

<p>It was no wonder, then, that Leola
followed Wizard Hermann unwillingly
into the musty-smelling library, with its
high walnut wainscot, dingy, green-stenciled
walls, and side shelves lined with
old leather volumes, while the bare
oaken floor on which she trod was worn
with the footsteps of successive generations
who had passed from earth in the
fullness of time and been gathered to
their fathers.</p>

<p>In the somber room with its closed
shutters Leola stood facing her grim
guardian with the impatient air of some
beautiful young princess giving audience
to a vassal.</p>

<p>As he stood hesitating where to begin,
with an unwonted diffidence, she said,
coldly:</p>

<p>“Speak; tell me your wish at once, sir,
for I must hurry. I have an engagement
in town with my dressmaker.”</p>

<p>At those words Wizard Hermann’s
gloomy brow cleared as if by magic, and
quickly striking his lean, scarred hands
together, he retorted, maliciously:</p>

<p>“An engagement with your dressmaker,
eh, my proud lady? Very well,
while you are there you may give the
woman an order for your wedding
gown.”</p>

<p>“Sir,” she uttered, in amazement, her
cheeks reddening.</p>

<p>Wizard Hermann retorted, with a
hoarse, sardonic laugh:</p>

<p>“I said give the woman an order for
your wedding gown, Leola Mead, for
you are to be married soon.”</p>

<p>Leola stared, speechlessly, a moment,
wondering if the old man was losing his
mind, and, taking advantage of her silence,
he continued, with forced bravado:</p>

<p>“You look surprised, my haughty
young lady, so I will explain. I have
accepted a desirable proposal for your
hand, and as you are plenty old enough
to marry—nineteen your last birthday—I
have named the wedding for a month
from to-day.”</p>

<p>Leola, recovering her speech, cried, indignantly:</p>

<p>“Quite a cool proceeding on your part,
sir, I must say, but I wish you to understand
that I am not ready to marry
yet.”</p>

<p>“That makes no difference to me, for
you will have to obey me, Leola Mead,
understand that,” he replied, with rising
anger. “You are my ward, and in
pursuance of my duty to you, I have accepted
a man for your husband who
worships the ground you walk upon and
will spend money on you like water.”</p>

<p>Leola’s dark eyes blazed with indignation.</p>

<p>“You must surely be mad,” she cried,
passionately. “The man I would choose
for my husband must ask me for my
hand, not you, sir. This is free America,
you must remember, not France, where
marriages are arranged by old people
who have forgotten love and youth. I
refuse the suitor you have chosen for me
without even hearing his name!”</p>

<p>The old man muttered, sullenly.</p>

<p>“Marriage is the destiny of all young
girls. You would not wish to grow into
a sour old maid?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not intend to be an old maid,
sir, but,” with a proud toss of her lovely
head, “when I marry I shall choose the
man myself, and it shall be for love, not
money!”</p>

<p>“Money is the only thing worth having—money
and long life,” he muttered,
but Leola, with a contemptuous laugh,
turned to go.</p>

<p>He sprang between her and the door,
putting his back against it.</p>

<p>“I have not done telling you all about
this matter yet,” he exclaimed, but Leola
stamped her little foot in a fury, replying:</p>

<p>“I will not hear another word, I tell
you, and you may as well let me go, and
give up your foolish plans!”</p>

<p>“By Heaven, miss, you shall marry the
man of my choice—I swear it!” cried the
wizard, violently, but she answered,
coldly:</p>

<p>“Pray let me hear no more such nonsense,
Uncle Hermann. Granted you are
my guardian, the law does not give you
the power of marrying me to anyone
against my will. No, not another word,
or I shall think you are going insane, if
not so already. Get away from that
door, and let me out, or I shall scream
for assistance or jump out of the window!”</p>

<p>“You would not dare do either!” he
said.</p>

<p>Leola ran like a flash to the window,
pushing back the creaking shutters, letting
in a flood of June sunshine. The
next moment she sprang to the high sill,
crying, defiantly:</p>

<p>“Now, get away from that door or I
will jump out!”</p>

<p>The old man muttered, incredulously:
“You would break your neck!”</p>

<p>Leola answered, recklessly:</p>

<p>“I shall risk that unless you let me
out of the door. Come, now, I will count
ten. If you do not move before then I
am gone,” and drawing her dainty little
feet up into the window, and dangling
them on the outside, she began counting
in a clear, high voice:</p>

<p>“One—two—three—four—five—six—seven—eight—nine—ten!”</p>

<p>Wizard Hermann remained standing
with his back toward the door, regarding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
her with an incredulous leer, never
dreaming she would make the foolhardy
leap, for from the window sill it was
twenty feet to the ground.</p>

<p>But Leola was as good as her word.</p>

<p>While she counted she kept her flashing
dark eyes full upon his stubborn
face, and seeing that he did not move as
the last word left her lips, she deliberately
turned and sprang out upon the
ground.</p>

<p>A cry of alarm shrilled over the old
man’s lips, and he stood like one rooted
to the spot, listening for the cry of pain
that must announce the dread result of
the perilous leap. Visions of Leola crippled
or dead floated before his mind’s
eye, and he muttered, savagely:</p>

<p>“Little vixen, if you have broken your
neck it is your own fault! But if you
live you shall marry the man of my
choice one month from to-day, I swear it!”</p>

<p>The sound of her voice floated to him
indistinctly—was it a laugh or a groan?</p>

<p>He hurried to the window, shaking
with excitement.</p>

<p>There was Leola standing upright on
the greensward, brushing her blue skirt,
and humming a little song to herself.</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” he quavered, anxiously,
and she looked up, laughing maliciously:</p>

<p>“Hurt? Oh, no, not a bit!” she called
back, gayly. “I just let myself go limply,
and I came down like a cat on all
fours in the grass and clover. I have
fallen higher than that from trees many
a time without hurting myself. It’s
easy enough when you learn to go limp
and not stiffen yourself; ha, ha!”</p>

<p>As he glared in amazement she waved
her hand, audaciously, adding:</p>

<p>“You ought to try it yourself some
time, Uncle Hermann! Well, good-bye,
sir, and mind you don’t let me hear any
more of this match-making business,
unless you go and get married yourself!”
and with that parting shot, the merry
girl ran across the grass, a vision of
youth and health and beauty, to where
her pony was waiting, ready saddled, beneath
a tree. Vaulting lightly to his
back, without even waiting to fasten
the loosened tresses of her ruddy hair,
the wild young thing was off and away
down the mountain road, her young
bosom throbbing tumultuously, half with
anger, half with mirth, at the rencontre
with her guardian.</p>

<p>“The old silly, to think of marrying
me off, without so much as by your
leave! The idea!” she exclaimed aloud,
adding, more soberly, “Not that I’d mind
having a rich husband if he was handsome
and winning, too, but how often
I have heard it said that good looks and
riches seldom go together, so if that’s
the case I’d marry for love and let
money go!”</p>

<p>Her fit of anger dissolving in the sunshine
of sweet good nature, she hummed,
as she galloped on, a fragment of a tender
little love-song, sweet as it was sad:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent1">And the bee has had his hour.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Suddenly the low song died on her lips,
changing to a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>At a curve in the road she came suddenly
upon a startling sight.</p>

<p>Rex just swerved aside from a runaway
horse that was dragging behind it
a shattered little runabout, in which
stood upright a white-faced man, straining
desperately upon the reins, trying to
stop the maddened animal’s wild career.</p>

<p>Even in that terrible moment, with
the black horse plunging madly forward
to the imminent peril of the driver’s life,
Leola saw, as by a flash, that the man
was young and very, very handsome,
and her heart throbbed with wild pain
at his danger, for on one side the road
sloped, precipitously, downward to a
dangerous stream of water, and a plunge
over that steep incline meant death in
horrible form.</p>

<p>But what could avert the catastrophe,
for it seemed as if nothing could restrain
the plunging brute or turn aside his
maddened course toward the crumbling
edge of the yawning precipice that
would instantly engulf both in ruin and
death!</p>

<p>A cry of agony, “Oh, God, save him!”
shrilled over her rosy lips.</p>

<p>Surely the listening angels heard the
prayer, for suddenly she saw that there
was one chance in a thousand to avert
the threatening disaster—one chance,
though with deadly peril to herself.</p>

<p>With a high heart of hope, and a courage
that defied all the deadly risk, she
dared the consequences, spurring Rex
forward in front of the black horse with
a clarion call on her lips that wrought
what seemed like a miracle.</p>

<p>For at her voice, conjoined with a
startled whinny from Rex, the terrified
animal, plunging and rearing but an instant
before, with upraised hoofs nearing
the verge of the dangerous precipice,
now stopped as if shot, trembling
all over, while Leola, throwing out her
arms, caught his neck and clung, clung,
clung, with the energy of despair.</p>

<h3>ARE YOU AN ANGEL?</h3>


<p>What subtle influence wrought the
miracle, for it could not have been the
strength of Leola’s slender hands?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>But there stood the satanic black
animal, its fury abated, its flight arrested,
its huge form trembling, shuddering,
while the foamy sweat dropped
in streams to the ground. As for the
driver, he had been hurled violently
backward into the road by the impetus
of the sudden stop, and now lay there
without sound or motion, like a dead
man.</p>

<p>Leola, waiting only a moment to pat
the black horse gently on his heaving
neck, slipped from her saddle and ran to
the young man, leaving, oh, wonder of
wonders! the excited creature standing
stock still, and rubbing noses with Rex
quite as if they had been old friends.</p>

<p>“Oh, heaven, he is dead!” the girl
moaned in anguish.</p>

<p>Her heart sank like lead to see him
lying there so still, with a little stream
of blood trickling from his temple, where
it had struck against a jagged rock.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I only had some water,” she
sighed, and just then the trickle of a
little spring by the side of the road
caught her ears. She ran and filled her
riding cap with the clear fluid, and
dashed it in his face.</p>

<p>Oh, joy! he gasped once or twice, and
opened on her anxious face a pair of the
bonniest dark blue eyes she had ever
met—eyes that seemed to go exactly
with the glossy curls of thick brown
hair.</p>

<p>When his gaze met hers he smiled,
faintly, and sighed:</p>

<p>“I—I—where am I? Oh, I remember
now. I was in an accident; my horse
ran away, and I was thrown out of the
runabout. Was I killed? Is this heaven,
and are you an angel?”</p>

<p>Leola laughed a happy, rippling laugh,
sweet as music to his ears.</p>

<p>“An angel? No, indeed,” she cried;
“and this is not heaven, either, only a
rough, rocky road, where you fell when
you pitched out of your trap. Oh! are
you hurt very bad? Does your poor
head pain you very much?”</p>

<p>Their faces were very close together,
for she had pillowed his head on her
tender arm, and he could feel the quick
throbs of her excited heart as she waited
for his answer.</p>

<p>“I—I—do not feel very bad,” he began,
then suddenly lapsed into unconsciousness
again, and this time it seemed
to her that he was surely gone forever.</p>

<p>Tears started in her eyes and fell in a
burning shower upon his pallid, handsome
face, mingling with the crimson
rain that ran down his cheek.</p>

<p>Again he revived, and, looking up,
met that tender, tearful glance of Leola’s
lovely eyes, that made the blood leap
through his veins with rapture.</p>

<p>He said faintly:</p>

<p>“Do not say you are not an angel, for
I shall always think of you as one,
sweet girl! Ah, I remember all, now!
My runaway horse was going straight
over the declivity when you spurred
yours between and caught his neck in
your arms. It was a magnificent thing
to do, but a perilous one, too, to risk
your life for an utter stranger!”</p>

<p>Leola smiled brightly, and answered:</p>

<p>“It certainly looked like taking a terrible
risk, and would scarcely have succeeded
so well but for one fact quite
unknown to you.”</p>

<p>“And that?” he queried, eagerly; and
she replied:</p>

<p>“You see, I recognized in your satanic
steed a favorite of mine—a spirited
creature that I loved dearly when it belonged
to my guardian, who sold it to
the livery stable in town only a week
ago. Black Hawk, as we called him, was
an elder brother to my pony Rex, and
they were fond of each other; so, you
see, it was really our acquaintance with
Black Hawk that made him so easy to
subdue. Just turn your head now, sir,
and you will see the pair biting at each
other in the most affectionate manner.”</p>

<p>“It is wonderful,” he murmured; “but,
all the same, I owe you my life, for you
ran a terrible risk trusting to Black
Hawk’s possible obedience to you. What
if, in his fury of fear and rage—for he
had taken desperate fright at a well-digging
machine in a field—he had
proved unmanageable? You and I must
have gone down to death together, all
in one tragic moment.”</p>

<p>“It is true, but let us not think of it,
since the danger is past,” said Leola,
making light of it, and adding:</p>

<p>“What troubles me now is how to get
assistance for you. I don’t like to leave
you alone, but—Ah! I hear wheels.
Some one is coming!”</p>

<p>Sure enough, an old top buggy, drawn
by an old gray mare, came clattering
around the curve of the road, and in it
sat the one person most welcome of any
one in the world just now—the village
doctor.</p>

<p>“Oh, Doctor Barnes, how glad I am
to see you! You see, there’s been an accident,”
Leola cried, eagerly, as he drew
rein and began to jump nimbly out.</p>

<p>“Yes, my dear girl; I saw the accident
from up on the hill, just as I was coming
out from a patient’s house, and I got
to you as fast as old Dolly would travel.
Really, it was a splendid deed of daring!”
cried the middle-aged doctor, patting
her bright head in a fatherly way
as he stooped over the young man.</p>

<p>“Ah, a stranger!” he continued. “Well,
how much is he hurt? Cut on the temple,
eh? Needs some stitches. Any
bones broken, do you think? Wait till
I stanch and bind the wound, and then
we will see.”</p>

<p>This accomplished, he tendered the use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
of his arm, and the young fellow got
upon his feet without much difficulty.</p>

<p>“Ah, you’re all right—unless there’s
some internal hurt. Come, I will put
you into my buggy. Your arm on the
other side. Leola and I must take you
to the nearest house, which happens to
be the Widow Gray’s cottage, below here.
There I can sew up your wound and
leave you in safe hands till we can find
out if there’s any internal injuries. All
right. Put your head back against the
lap-robe. You will come with us, Leola;
I may need your help.”</p>

<p>Stranger as the young man was, they
could not have taken him to a better
place, for Widow Gray was the dearest
old woman in the neighborhood. She
lived quite alone in a tidy cottage back
among a grove of maples, or a “sugar
camp,” as the country people called it;
for here in the early spring was always
produced that toothsome dainty, maple
sugar, so dear to the hearts of school
children. The widow had a neat spare
room that she often let to a summer
boarder, and to this white-hung chamber
she quickly led Doctor Barnes with
his patient, her round face beaming with
good-nature as she promised to do all
she could for the unfortunate young
stranger.</p>

<p>“He will need your best nursing, I
fear,” exclaimed Doctor Barnes; for, on
getting his patient down upon the bed,
he immediately fainted again, and the
swoon was so deep that it was difficult
to revive him.</p>

<p>“Oh, he is dead!” sobbed Leola; and
the thought carried with it such agony
that it changed and darkened the whole
world to her young heart, so dear had
the handsome stranger grown already.</p>

</div>

<h3>BEWARE OF JEALOUSY.</h3>


<p>How glad she was when he opened
his eyes again, and faltered:</p>

<p>“I am quite ashamed of myself, fainting
away like a weak woman. I will
promise not to do so again, doctor.”</p>

<p>Doctor Barnes quickly made him as
easy as possible, and left him to the
widow’s care, promising to call again
that evening to see how he fared, and
also to send word to the livery stable
about the horse and trap.</p>

<p>Leola felt she had no further excuse
for staying, although, somehow, she
could not bear to go.</p>

<p>She went into the room to say farewell,
and he entreated her to stay, in a
weak voice, reinforced by pleading eyes.</p>

<p>She smiled, and shook her head.</p>

<p>“It is better I should go now, for the
doctor says you must have absolute rest
and quiet to-day, and I am a sad chatterbox,
but I will come to-morrow and
bring you some flowers,” she promised.</p>

<p>She pressed his hand in mute farewell,
and the contact thrilled her with rapturous
emotion, for even with his pallor
and his bandaged head he appeared to
her a king among men—a veritable
Prince Charming.</p>

<p>A great change had come to her heart
since she rode out so blithely that morning,
and the words of her simple song
were coming true:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A honey-comb and a honey-flower.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And the bee shall have his hour.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She forgot all about her errand to
town, and, remounting Rex, went for a
long ride, miles away, to a beautiful
Blue Sulphur Spring, where she lingered
for hours upon the green lawn, dreaming
over and over the startling event of the
day, and gazing anon into the sparkling
depths of the water, as if she might read
in its pellucid depths the secret of her
future.</p>

<p>And she recalled, with a sudden thrill,
the gypsy who had told her fortune last
year, saying:</p>

<p>“You will have a handsome, blue-eyed
husband, and you will adore each other;
but beware of jealousy, or it will part
you forever.”</p>

<p>Leola had laughed at the gypsy then,
but now she recalled her prophecy with
a prophetic thrill.</p>

<p>“A handsome, blue-eyed husband! He
has blue eyes!” she said—which showed
that her thoughts already reached forward
to the unknown future.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Our feelings and our thoughts</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Tend ever on and rest not in the present.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>When she returned home she had temporarily
forgotten all about her little tiff
with Wizard Hermann that morning,
and as she saw him nowhere about, it
did not occur to her mind. She avoided
every one, which was not hard to do,
the household consisting of only five
members—her guardian and self, her
former governess, who now combined
teaching and housekeeping by way of
economy, a fat black cook, and a man
of all work, a misshapen, dwarfish creature
of tremendous strength.</p>

<p>The day and night seemed interminably
long to Leola, who lay awake many
hours through pure joy of this blissful
something that had come so suddenly
into the placid current of her young life.
Heaven forefend her from ever knowing
the wakefulness of sorrow!</p>

<p>Bright and early the next morning she
was out in the old-fashioned garden,
gathering roses, dewy sweet and lovely,
and it was not difficult to coax black
Betsy for a bit of early breakfast before
the others appeared.</p>

<p>Then, because she did not want to seem
too anxious, Leola walked the two miles
to Widow Gray’s cottage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>When Wizard Hermann asked at
breakfast after the truant, Betsy, who
was bringing in the toast, answered that
“young miss” had gone to carry some
flowers to a sick friend.</p>

<p>“Humph!” was his careless rejoinder,
little dreaming that the sick friend was
a charming young man who had already
carried Leola’s heart by storm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the young girl went blithely
on her way, glad at heart with a
strange, new emotion, yet not realizing
why the world seemed so much sweeter
than yesterday, the flowers fairer, the
skies brighter, and all nature attuned to
a diviner melody. Even her own rare
beauty had gained another indefinable
charm from the vibrations of love,
pulsing joyfully through all her frame.
She knew that she was drawn by invisible
cords to the handsome stranger, but
she imputed it to keen interest in one
she had saved from death.</p>

<p>Widow Gray welcomed her with beaming
smiles.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Mead, such a rapid improvement
you never saw in your life! Why,
after he had rested all day and night, he
was like another man, and the doctor let
him dress this morning and lie on the
lounge in his room. He says he has no
internal trouble at all, and need only
stay in a few days till his head gets well.
Wasn’t he lucky? for the doctor says the
tumble might have killed him, and that
it was a miracle it didn’t. But, laws,
he’s as right as a trivet, and has taken
a poached egg and bit of toast this morning.
What sweet, sweet flowers! Come
right in, do, and see him; he’s expecting
you.”</p>

<p>How his blue eyes beamed as she entered
with the flowers! Leola would
never forget that look to her dying day.</p>

<p>“You are come at last!” he cried, happily.
“I have been hoping and watching
for you more than an hour! I should
have been in a fever of impatience if
you had stayed away much longer!”</p>

<p>“And yet it is quite early. See, the
dew is not yet dry on the roses I brought
you,” smiled Leola, as she drew a chair
close to his side.</p>

<p>“Are you not glad I escaped with so
slight injury?” he exclaimed, joyously.
“And only to think that I owe my life
to you! How can I repay you but by devoting
it to your service?”</p>

<p>This was very rapid love-making, indeed.
Leola, with her very limited experience
that way, felt it was so, yet
somehow she could not chide him. Her
heart beat very fast, her cheeks flamed
crimson, and when she tried to look
away from him she could not help his
gaze from holding hers in a long look
into her soul that was trying to hide
from him beneath her dark, curling lashes.
In that moment of pure rapture Sir
Cupid transfixed both their hearts with
his cunning arrow. They were no more
strangers; they seemed to have known
each other in some past incarnation.</p>

<p>Leola thought, thrillingly:</p>

<p>“Surely this is love that makes my
heart beat so fast and my cheeks burn
under his glance, that holds my own so
that I cannot look away! He is my
fate!”</p>

<p>The young stranger was saying to himself,
quite as romantically:</p>

<p>“Before I saw this exquisite creature
I was madly in love with her shadow,
and now that we have met, my heart is
in her keeping forever. I owe her my
very life, and I will be her true knight—and
swear eternal fealty to my liege
lady!”</p>

<p>He reached out and caught her hand,
saying, deeply and tenderly:</p>

<p>“Forgive me if I seem too hasty, but
something urges me on to confess my
love before some unknown fate comes
between us. Leola, am I too hasty, or
may I hope to win your heart?”</p>

<p>The lashes fell against her blushing
cheeks as she murmured:</p>

<p>“I—I—how strange that you have
learned to love me—like that—since only
yesterday!”</p>

<p>“I loved you weeks before I ever met
you,” was his startling reply; and as
she cried out in wonder over that, he
continued, fondly:</p>

<p>“A few weeks ago, in New York, a
young lady loaned me some negatives to
copy. She had made them with her
camera while out in the mountains last
summer, she said. Among these negatives
were such charming views of a
young girl, that I fell in love with the
pictures as soon as I made them. I did
not rest until I found out where the girl
lived, her name, and, in short, all there
was to learn about her. Then I took the
train for West Virginia, and on arriving
at Alderson I started out the same morning
to find you, Leola; for, of course, you
have guessed it was yourself! Directly
my horse took fright; and only fancy
my feelings when I saw you coming
toward me on your white pony, a perfect
vision of youth and joy and beauty, and
realized that a horrible death might
thrust us apart in another fatal moment.
You saved my life, and can you wonder
I look upon you as my fate—the fairest
fate that ever life gave to a man?”</p>

<p>He paused, pressed the hand he held
again ardently, and added, musingly:</p>

<p>“How strangely everything has come
about! I thought I should have to get
acquainted with you in a very proper
way, and go through a ceremonious
courtship before I proposed, but fate took
it all out of my hands. Now, what have
you to say to this, my dear girl? Will
you let me hope to win your love?”</p>

<p>“It is yours already,” Leola confessed,
with exquisite frankness; then, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
rapturously kissed her trembling hand,
she exclaimed, in wonder at herself:</p>

<p>“Oh, perhaps you think I am too lightly
won when I do not even know your
name!”</p>

<p>“That can be remedied very soon. Call
me Ray Chester, an artist, who wishes
he were richer for your sweet sake.”</p>

<p>“Then you are poor?” Leola questioned,
gravely.</p>

<p>“Do you regret it?” he asked, sadly.</p>

<p>“I—I—don’t know. Cousin Jessie always
advised me never to marry poor.
It is Jessie Stirling, I mean. She loaned
you the negatives, did she not?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I am sorry she put such notions
in your pretty head. Perhaps you
will take back your promise, learning I
am poor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, no! Never! I could not
marry any one without love, but Jessie
says she would take a fright if he had a
million dollars. However, she has
‘hooked,’ so she says, a big fish, rich,
and young, and handsome, too, and she
wants, when she is married, for me to
visit her so she can make a grand match
for me.”</p>

<p>“I will save her the trouble,” said Ray
Chester. “Love in a cottage will be our
portion, my darling, but you are so lovely
that I shall paint a picture of you
that will perhaps make my fortune!”</p>

<p>Suddenly a shadow clouded her lovely
eyes. She had remembered for the first
time her guardian’s threat of yesterday.</p>

<p>“You look sad, Leola. Are you repenting
your promise already?” her lover
cried, anxiously.</p>

<p>“I shall never repent. I believe you
are my fate!” the girl exclaimed, earnestly,
and to herself she thought:</p>

<p>“I will not tell him of my guardian’s
foolish plans for wedding me to a rich
man yet, for perhaps he will give it up
after my frank refusal to obey him. No;
I will not even think of it again; he
cannot coerce me, for I will tell him I
have already chosen my husband.”</p>

<h3>A HONEY BEE AND A HONEY FLOWER.</h3>


<p>The Widow Gray had a very romantic
turn of mind, and she had not forgotten
her young days yet, so it was easy
enough for her to find out that the two
young folks were already deeply in love.</p>

<p>“And no wonder, either,” she said to
herself, sagely, “for the two beautiful
young things seem to be made for each
other.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, she helped out the romance
all she could by insisting on the
girl’s coming every day to help while
away the invalid’s lonely hours, saying,
cheerfully:</p>

<p>“For you know that just as soon as
Mr. Chester gets well enough to be going
about he will be right up at Wheatlands,
paying back your visits two to one.”</p>

<p>Thus encouraged, Leola came and
went daily, making long visits without
exciting any suspicion at home, for she
was used to having her own way, and
no one interfered with her liberty.</p>

<p>It was quite a week that Ray Chester
was detained at the cottage, for although
he made light of his injuries, he
was very much bruised, and felt stiff
and sore, and the little gash on his temple
was deep enough to take some time
in healing, and even then it would leave
a scar under his thick, brown curls that
would always remain to remind him of
lovely Leola’s bravery in saving his life
at the risk of her own.</p>

<p>But that week went away so quickly,
so happily, in that golden June weather,
that when it was over they could not
realize the lapse of days.</p>

<p>“It seemed like one exquisite day,”
they said to each other.</p>

<p>The programme of their days had been
something like this:</p>

<p>Leola called every morning on Rex,
and remained until the midday meal at
Wheatlands. After appearing at this
hour she slipped away again, returning
to the cottage and staying till she had to
go home to supper. Her regularity at
these meals warded off any suspicion
that she spent the intervening hours in
the company of a very charming young
man, who would render all Wizard Hermann’s
schemes to marry her off to her
unknown suitor quite null and void.</p>

<p>After supper, then, came the lonely
time, for Leola had to remain at home
and play to the governess on the piano
in the dingy parlor, whose faded hangings
had not been renovated for years.
As this had been a yearly practice, she
could not omit it without exciting wonder
on the part of the spinster lady who
had acted as her governess and companion
since early childhood, and, now
that school days were over, looked after
the housekeeping, staying on indefinitely,
not seeming to have either friends or
suitors.</p>

<p>Yet, although she was over forty now,
Miss Tuttle had not given over a scarcely-concealed
hope of marrying.</p>

<p>As she was very thin and tall, her
secret choice had fallen on her exact
opposite, a neighboring widower about
fifty, who was rather short and very
stout, and had recently come into a fortune
by selling some valuable coal-lands
in Greenbrier county.</p>

<p>Miss Tuttle having been in love with
neighbor Bennett when he was in moderate
circumstances, only loved him the
harder when he became so rich that he
did not know how to spend his money.</p>

<p>Some neighborly kindnesses he had
certainly shown her, but not as many
as she wished, and no amount of scheming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
had sufficed to bring him to the
point of proposing.</p>

<p>Thus absorbed in her own love-affair,
it was no wonder that Miss Tuttle paid
small attention to Leola’s comings and
goings, regarding her still as a pretty
child who had heretofore laughed at love
and lovers.</p>

<p>So there were none to molest the lovers
and make them afraid, for Wizard Hermann,
though he did not give over his
scheme, held his peace and went his way
in cunning silence, giving Leola time to
get over her fright.</p>

<p>Even Doctor Barnes, who had not
found it necessary to pay but three visits
to his patient, did not know of the
romance going on at the cottage, and
being very busy with the measles, just
then epidemic in Alderson and the country
round about, he had no time to gossip
about the stranger whose life Leola
Mead had saved. As there were none
who knew Ray Chester, so there were
none to worry over him; and beneath
the matronly chaperonage of kind Widow
Gray their secret love bloomed into a
splendid flower whose strong roots only
death could tear away.</p>

</div>

<p>“It cannot surely be a whole week;
was it not only yesterday?” cried the
doting lover.</p>

<p>But Leola counted off the days to him
on her rosy fingers.</p>

<p>“It was Tuesday when first we met—Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and now it
is Tuesday again! And I have been to
see you twice every day, Ray! But to-morrow
I cannot come at all, for there
is a horrid picnic to which Miss Tuttle
insists on taking me, and I cannot refuse
lest she find me out.”</p>

<p>“Why, then, I shall go to the picnic,
too. I adore picnics!” cried Ray Chester.</p>

<p>“But you are not invited. It’s a Sunday
school picnic, you see, Ray, and you
are not acquainted with anybody.”</p>

<p>“I’ll invite myself, and get acquainted
with everybody there in less than an
hour,” he answered, gayly; and calling
to Mrs. Gray, who was watering her
geraniums in the yard, he said:</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to the picnic to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so—only I shall have to leave
you a cold dinner,” she said, hesitatingly,
coming up to the vine-wreathed
porch in whose shadow the lovers were
sitting.</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you if you let me!” cried
Ray; “and you will introduce me to
everybody there as your new boarder.”</p>

<p>“And to Miss Tuttle in particular; and
mind you show her much attention, Ray,
for then she will ask you to Wheatlands,”
laughed Leola, falling into the
spirit of the thing, for it came to her
suddenly that by this means she and
Ray could go on courting under her
guardian’s very nose without being suspected.</p>

<p>“Miss Tuttle is so vain she will easily
think Ray is in love with her,” she
thought, merrily, and so they all laid
their plans for to-morrow.</p>

<p>The picnic came off in a beautiful
grove, and Widow Gray’s new boarder
kept his word, and got acquainted with
everybody there inside of an hour.</p>

<p>He was specially gracious to the smiling
Miss Tuttle, who herself presented
him to Leola, saying:</p>

<p>“Miss Mead, the little girl to whom I
have been governess over ten years.”</p>

<p>The little girl bowed demurely, and
said she was glad to meet Miss Tuttle’s
friend, and then she turned carelessly
away, and was particular not to interrupt
his chat with the spinster until by
his assiduity he got the coveted invitation
to call.</p>

<h3>LOVE’S ENTANGLEMENTS.</h3>


<p>“Isn’t he perfectly charming, Leola?
As handsome as a picture, and the prettiest
manners I ever saw—so courteous,
so kind, altogether different from some
of the country bumpkins about here,
who don’t seem to appreciate ladies as
they ought. But really, for the life of
me, I cannot tell which one of us he is
courting, for he is so nice to us both.
Sometimes I think it’s you, and then,
again, I may be the object of his affection.
I cannot deny there may be a
little disparity in our years, but I do
not believe he would mind that, do you,
dear?”</p>

<p>This was two weeks later than the picnic,
from which it may be inferred that
Ray Chester’s courtship was progressing
finely, without let or hindrance from
Wizard Hermann.</p>

<p>Fortune had favored our daring hero,
for Leola’s guardian had been absent
from home nearly two weeks, and on returning
he had resumed his laboratory
work with such zeal that he remained
quite in ignorance of the fact that a
handsome young man, a stranger from
the city, was a daily and welcome caller
on the ladies of his family.</p>

<p>His first news of the fact came from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
Mr. Bennett, his rich and rotund neighbor,
who, perhaps growing jealous over
Miss Tuttle, desired to know if Mr. Hermann
had any knowledge of the
stranger’s intentions.</p>

<p>“In a word, sir, is the fellow sparking
Miss Tuttle or Leola?” he said, brusquely.</p>

<p>Mr. Hermann, startled, denied any
knowledge of the young man.</p>

<p>“I’ve been up to New York for some
precious chemicals I required, and I
was nearly ten days absent. Since I returned
I’ve been almost too busy to take
time to eat or sleep, and I have not seen
or heard of any young man,” he declared.</p>

<p>The sleek Bennett soon made him acquainted
with the facts as he knew them
himself.</p>

<p>“The fellow’s from the city, somewhere
away off, good-looking and dandyfied, an
artist, he claims to be. He’s boarding
down to Widow Gray’s, and showed
himself first at a picnic, where he came
with her and got introduced to the whole
country-side. I’m not saying he isn’t as
pleasant a young chap as I ever met, but
I don’t like it, seeing him in and out at
Wheatlands all the time without knowing
for sure who he’s after, Hermann,”
he concluded, uneasily.</p>

<p>“I’ll look into the matter this very
day and find out what’s in the wind,”
was the reassuring reply.</p>

<p>Bennett’s little ferret eyes looked
sharply at him, and he muttered:</p>

<p>“I won’t have any fooling over this
here bargain. The mortgage falls due
pretty soon now, and if you fail to keep
your word, I’ll foreclose at once, I
swear.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep it to the letter: don’t you be
uneasy,” soothed Wizard Hermann, adding:</p>

<p>“Have you done anything to help along
your own cause, eh?”</p>

<p>“I’ve called several times and fetched
the geerls presents of fruit and candy,
and took ’em riding in my fine new
turnout, but that dad-blame dandy was
always along, and I couldn’t hardly get
in a word edgeways to the geerl, and
Miss Tuttle, she done all the talking to
me, so’s I hadn’t any show at all with
Leola,” Bennett muttered, morosely.</p>

<p>“Let’s see; suppose you write a letter
and propose formally for her hand. Tell
her how rich you are, and that you’ll
give her anything her heart craves. If
she refuses, then I shall have to use my
influence,” Wizard Hermann said, consolingly,
wishing he were well out of all
this bother and back in his laboratory
at work with his beloved chemicals.</p>

<p>His house and lands were all mortgaged
to his rich neighbor, and he had
not a dollar to pay him to prevent foreclosure.
It seemed like a providence
when the rich widower cast his covetous
eyes on lovely Leola, and offered, if Hermann
could get her to marry him, to release
the debt.</p>

<p>It was fifteen thousand dollars, but
Wheatlands, with its wide-spreading
acres, was worth twice as much, and it
was terrible to thus sacrifice the home
of his forefathers; so Hermann, who
had burned up all that money in his
foolish and mysterious experiments, decided
that Leola must be sacrificed to
pay the debt, since there was no other
way.</p>

<p>But how to obtain her consent he did
not know, and, since the morning when
she had so angrily repulsed him, the
subject had tacitly dropped between
them, Hermann realizing that his end
could only be gained by force and cunning.</p>

<p>Bennett’s story about a possible rival
put a new element of trouble into the affair,
so he set himself to investigate
matters by calling the governess to account.</p>

<p>When he summoned her to the library
she thought he only wanted to go over
some housekeeping accounts with her,
or possibly to pay some arrears of her
salary long overdue.</p>

<p>Visions of a new gown and bonnet
floated joyfully before her mind’s eye,
but she was soon undeceived.</p>

<p>“Who and what of this young dandy
who is making so free of my house these
two weeks?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Miss Tuttle bridled, and tried to blush
like an eighteen-year-old girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Hermann, the most charming
young man—he’s a boarder at Widow
Gray’s, and is most attentive,” she simpered.</p>

<p>“So I have heard, but who is he after—Leola?”
he demanded.</p>

<p>“Oh, sir, no, indeed—that is, I cannot
really be sure of his intentions toward
either; he’s so very charming to both of
us we cannot decide between us which
he prefers yet—but he does not seem like
a flirt!”</p>

<p>“Amanda Tuttle, don’t be an old fool!
How do you suppose any young man
could hesitate between an old woman
like you and pretty Leola?” he replied,
brusquely.</p>

<p>“Sir!” Miss Tuttle bridled, and tears
came into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, well, I spoke roughly, but you
should not be so silly,” returned her employer.
“Remember you were not very
pretty when you first came here, and
fifteen years has changed you into a
faded old maid.”</p>

<p>“I—I—hate you!” she sobbed, pitifully.</p>

<p>“Hard words break no bones,” he said,
carelessly.</p>

<p>“If you will pay me my salary I’ll
leave Wheatlands forever!” she sobbed,
bitterly, in her humiliation; but he went
on, coolly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“No, I don’t want you to leave; I really
need your services, Miss Tuttle. But as
to whether you ever get that money I
owe you depends on your own exertions.
I’ve lost everything, and unless Leola
makes a rich marriage I’ve planned for
her, I will not have a roof over my head
this day month.”</p>

<p>Miss Tuttle mopped her wet eyes with
a little lace-edged handkerchief, and
straightened up, full of breathless curiosity.</p>

<p>“Oh, who is he?” she exclaimed; and
thereupon he suddenly confided his difficulties
freely to her, hopeful of her
ready co-operation, but, being totally
unversed in the intricacies of a woman’s
heart, he made the mistake of his life.</p>

<p>On learning that the rotund widower,
Bennett, whom she secretly loved, was
a suitor for Leola’s hand, the spinster
promptly went into hysterics that she
could not have helped to save her life.</p>

<p>She shrieked furiously:</p>

<p>“Oh, the fat villain, the vile deceiver!
After all his attentions to me since his
poor wife died, to turn around and fall
in love with a chit of a girl like Leola!
Oh, I could tear him limb from limb, the
wretch! And as to marrying him, she
shall not—never, never!”</p>

<p>“Oh, really, really!” soothed her employer,
but all to no purpose, for, her
heart being touched, she could not restrain
her excitable feelings, but raved
on angrily and tearfully for some time,
until her emotion spent itself, the old
man having bided his time to this end.</p>

<p>He now observed, sarcastically:</p>

<p>“If you have done making a fool of
yourself now, Amanda Tuttle, perhaps
you will tell me what you are going to
do about it. You cannot marry Bennett
if he will not have you.”</p>

<p>“No,” she moaned, tearfully; and he
continued, coolly:</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will bring suit for breach
of promise.”</p>

<p>Miss Tuttle fairly tore her hair in her
humiliation.</p>

<p>“Will you, now?” he repeated.</p>

<p>“No,” she sobbed, suddenly realizing
that she really had no grounds to base a
legal action upon. She had built her
hopes on a baseless fabric of neighborly
politeness, nothing more, and her
house of cards had tumbled to the
ground.</p>

<p>The revulsion from long hope to sudden
despair was so bitter that it awakened
an intense and jealous hatred for
Leola, superseding the devotion of years.</p>

<p>Hermann realized that he had made a
mistake in taking her into his confidence,
and made a masterly retreat, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Oh, well, well, don’t take it so hard,
Amanda Tuttle; you’re too old to behave
like a love-sick chit! It isn’t likely that
Leola will want to marry him, anyhow,
and if she refuses, of course I must let
old Bennett take the house and everything,
and we can all go to the almshouse
together!”</p>

</div>

<h3>BOAST NOT THYSELF OF TO-MORROW.</h3>


<p>It was the bitterest hour of her life to
poor Miss Tuttle.</p>

<p>While she was talking to old Hermann
she heard merry voices out of doors, and
knew that Ray Chester had arrived and
was sitting out in the rose arbor laughing
and talking with beautiful Leola,
who had turned out to be her rival when
she thought her only a merry-hearted
young girl.</p>

<p>She wondered if it could be true, as
her employer said, that no one would
look at her twice when his lovely ward
was by, and now she sadly remembered
several little things that made her sure
that his words were true.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when the three went for
long walks together, the younger pair
would quite tire her out, but they would
insist on going still further, leaving her
waiting under some shady tree with a
novel for an hour sometimes, while they
hunted wild flowers or bird’s nests, and
their happy laughter would come ringing
back as if they did not miss her in the
least, as now she suddenly realized
they did not; they only wanted her for
an elderly chaperon.</p>

<p>But somehow this did not hurt her as
much as the seeming perfidy of Widower
Bennett, whom she loved with all her
warm heart and at whom she had been
making tender eyes ever since his wife
died a year or so ago. She had persuaded
herself she would be the most proper
wife he could find anywhere, and to find
Leola preferred before herself was like
the bitterness of death.</p>

<p>She could not help envying and hating
the lovely girl with the weakness of a
shallow nature suddenly roused to bitter
jealousy, and when she hurried away
from Wizard Hermann’s presence to her
own room, she was half resolved to pack
her trunk and go away forever to hide
her humiliation and grief.</p>

<p>But while she bathed her stained face
and smoothed her rather pretty brown
hair, she reflected that she had nowhere
to go, for all her relatives were dead, and
she had no friends of any consequence.</p>

<p>Poor soul, how she longed for a home
and husband of her own! But the realization
of her dream seemed further off
than ever now, and as she stood at her
window gulping down her piteous sobs,
she heard again, from the rose arbor,
the gay laughter of the lovers, and curiosity
made her descend to them, wondering
what had caused their mirth.</p>

<p>Leola, as pretty as a flower in her
white gown, had a letter in her hand,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
and she and Ray, with their heads very
close, were laughing over it together.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Tuttle, this is so ridiculous
I have laughed till I cried,” said Leola.
“Only think, I have a lover, and he has
made me a proposal of marriage.”</p>

<p>“And,” added Ray, laughingly, “it is
such a brilliant and desirable match that
she is almost sorry she had promised to
marry me before she received it!”</p>

<p>“So you two are engaged?” cried Miss
Tuttle, feeling the ground sink beneath
her feet.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Miss Tuttle, and I know you
are not surprised. Won’t you congratulate
us?” cried Leola’s handsome lover.</p>

<p>“But please, please, don’t tell Uncle
Hermann, for I think I begin to see
through his plans now, and he will never
consent for me to marry a poor artist
when I could marry his rich neighbor,
old Mr. Bennett,” laughed Leola.</p>

<p>Poor Miss Tuttle gasped for breath,
and sank helplessly on a garden chair,
wishing she were dead and buried, so
keen was her pain and humiliation.</p>

<p>“You may read the old man’s letter if
you like,” added the girl, thrusting it
into her hand.</p>

<p>The sorrowful spinster, who would
have given all she possessed for such a
letter, was forced to read the gushing
and awkward love letter of the rich old
widower to the merry girl, who laughed
over it with her handsome young lover,
and gayly passed around the fine box of
bonbons that accompanied the epistle.</p>

<p>“The dear old silly! I thought he
looked on me still as a little girl,” she
cried. “Now if he had only been sensible
and asked you, Miss Tuttle, it would
have been a charming arrangement in
point of age and all that, you know.”</p>

<p>Miss Tuttle winced at the innocent
thrust of the happy girl, but she was so
miserable that her pride fell from her
like a garment, and she frankly assented,
saying:</p>

<p>“Yes, for I always admired Mr. Bennett,
and if he had asked me I would
have accepted him.”</p>

<p>The young people instantly felt very
sorry and sympathetic, and Leola proposed
that when she gave him her answer
she should give him a hint that he
would be more successful with the governess
than with the pupil.</p>

<p>Miss Tuttle was so moved by this offer
that she felt all her anger and jealousy
give way, and took Leola into her heart
again.</p>

<p>“Oh, if you could only manage it I
would be grateful forever,” she exclaimed.
“You know I cannot stay on
at Wheatlands when you are gone,
Leola, for people would talk, and besides
the fact that he is in arrears for my
salary, we have had a bitter quarrel this
morning,” and then, between tears and
sobs, she blurted out all Wizard Hermann’s
plans to the astonished lovers.</p>

<p>Then Leola recalled the morning, three
weeks ago, when her guardian had bidden
her prepare to be married in a
month to the man of his choice.</p>

<p>“So this is my rich suitor—old Bennett!”
she burst out, laughing, for she
could not regard it seriously at all, not
realizing Wizard Hermann’s grim determination.</p>

<p>“Why do you call him old? He is only
about fifty or so, and a fine, handsome
man!” complained the tearful governess.</p>

<p>She could hardly understand why the
volatile Leola burst into spasms of the
merriest laughter, in which Ray Chester
could not help joining. Alas, they were
so gay and happy, they were full of joy
and laughter, little dreaming of the
tragic moment near at hand when tears
would come more readily than smiles,
and the dull ache at the heart would be
like a piercing thorn.</p>

<p>“If I were you, Leola, I would not feel
so gay, for your guardian swears he
will enforce his authority and have you
marry Mr. Bennett, willy-nilly!” reproved
Miss Tuttle, anxiously.</p>

<p>The girl looked gayly at her lover, and
he caught her little hand in his, saying,
tenderly:</p>

<p>“We aren’t afraid of him, are we, my
precious Leola? And if the worst comes
to the worst, we will elope to Washington
and get married before old Bennett
knows what we are up to.”</p>

<p>“If you were only rich there needn’t be
any trouble. You could pay off the mortgage
for Mr. Hermann, and then he
would be willing enough for you to have
Leola!” suggested Miss Tuttle, inquiringly.</p>

<p>Ray’s dark blue eyes looked questioningly
into those of his bonny sweetheart.</p>

<p>“Are you sorry I’m not rich? Would
you rather have your old suitor?” he
asked, gently.</p>

<p>“Nonsense; I’d take you without a
coat to your back before I would have
that old Falstaff, with all his money,”
she answered, laughingly, and they dismissed
the thought of danger, for how
could anyone force a girl to marry
against her will?</p>

<p>“But perhaps, after all, I had better
see your guardian, and ask him for his
consent to our marriage?” questioned
Ray.</p>

<p>The governess shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, do not anger him now, for he is
really in such a rage he might set the
dogs on you, who knows?”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well, we need not hurry. It
will all blow over by-and-by,” cried
Leola, in her happy-go-lucky way, and
presently, when Ray had taken leave,
she went up to her room and penned an
amiable but decided refusal of Mr. Bennett’s
offer, saying she would prefer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
marry a younger man, and frankly advising
him to turn his attention to Miss
Tuttle, who admired him immensely, and
would make him the best wife in the
world.</p>

<p>When she showed this effort to the
governess, that lady promptly hugged
and kissed her, and declared she was the
dearest girl on earth.</p>

<p>A special messenger carried the missive
over to the Bennett place, and Leola
congratulated herself that the episode
was closed.</p>

<p>But who can tell what a day may
bring forth?</p>

<p>Leola’s whole life had been carelessly
happy, for she was blessed with one of
those sweet, sunshiny natures that always
look on the bright side, and find
pleasure in the simple joys of even a
quiet life. She made her own sunshine
as she went.</p>

<p>For more than three weeks now she
had been blissfully happy—so happy that
in all her future she will look back in
wonder that such perfect happiness could
be, for, alas, this was the end of those
golden days of love’s sweet dream.</p>

<p>That night, at supper, Wizard Hermann
said, casually, as if it were a matter
of small moment:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Stirling and Jessie will arrive
on the early train to-morrow.”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<h3>WINDING A WEB.</h3>


<p>When Miss Tuttle and Leola were alone
together they talked over the news, and
neither one was very well pleased, the girl,
since their coming would break up her
happy days with Ray, and the governess,
because the Stirlings were always supercilious
with her, and naturally made more
work for the household.</p>

<p>“I do not see why I should put myself
out to wait on pretentious fine ladies this
warm weather, especially when my employer
has not paid a dollar of my salary
for five months,” she complained, and Leola
added:</p>

<p>“There will be no more good times with
Ray, for like as not they will join hands
with Uncle Hermann in persecuting him,
and try to have me marry old Bennett because
he is rich. Oh, dear! I’m sorry Ray
isn’t coming back to-night, so I could tell
him not to come to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You might send word to him in the
morning before they come,” suggested
Miss Tuttle, and Leola agreed to the plan,
which would have worked itself out all
right had not fate decreed that Leola’s
little black messenger should lose the note
and Widower Bennett find it.</p>

<p>He was riding briskly toward Wheatlands
when his fine bay mare shied, wildly,
at a square white envelope blowing about
in the dusty road, and an impulse of curiosity
made him dismount and pick it up.</p>

<p>When he saw Leola’s familiar writing on
the sealed envelope, he was seized with
such poignant wrath and jealousy that no
scruple of honor prevailed to prevent his
becoming master of the contents.</p>

<p>“To Ray Chester, the young dandy—wonder
if she’s giving him the mitten as she
did me yesterday!” he muttered, wrathfully,
and broke the pretty seal of blue
wax with a ruthless hand.</p>

<p>The blood bounded hotly through his
veins as he read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
“My Own Darling Ray:<br>
</p>

<p>“You must not come in the morning as
usual, because the Stirlings are coming,
Uncle Hermann says, and I do not want
them to know of our engagement yet, for
they both are very mercenary, and would
take sides against you, and want me to
marry old Bennett, because he is rich,
while you are poor! As if I would have
that dumpy old fright on any terms—no,
not even if he were President of the United
States! Oh, why didn’t the old silly lose
his heart to dear Miss Tuttle instead of
me, when she loves the very ground he
walks on, and would make him such a
suitable wife? Fate seems to play at cross
purposes with us, my darling Ray, but
we will outwit our enemies and be happy
yet.</p>

<p>“You had better not come to Wheatlands
to-day, but if you will stay in all afternoon,
I will try to make an errand to
Widow Gray’s, and we can talk things over
and make plans for the future.</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t it just hateful the way things
seem to work against our happiness? Just
think, if only Jessie Stirling hadn’t got
engaged to a fortune already, we might
get my rotund suitor in love with her, and
she could have all the money she craves.</p>

<p>“Be sure to stay in until I come this
afternoon.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 5em;">Your own loving</span><br>
“Leola.”<br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Widower Bennett stamped upon the
ground in a fury, hissing out the epithets
she had used in writing of him in the
bitterest voice ever heard:</p>

<p>“‘Old Bennett!’ ‘Dumpy old fright!’ ‘Old
silly!’ ‘My rotund suitor!’ She would not
marry me if I were President of the United
States! Why, now, I swear I will marry
the little spitfire if it costs me my fortune!”</p>

<p>In this rage he remounted his mare and
galloped on to Wheatlands, between whose
master and himself there ensued an excited
interview.</p>

<p>Leola’s letter refusing Bennett’s hand
was exhibited in furious anger by the
slighted recipient.</p>

<p>“She would prefer to marry a younger
man than me, and she recommends me to
take Miss Tuttle—that skinny, homely old
maid, almost as old as I am!” he blustered,
wrathfully, adding:</p>

<p>“You promised faithfully she should marry
me, Hermann, but instead of watching
her as you ought, you go poking among
your old chemicals, as blind as a bat, and
let her get engaged to a pretty-faced young
jackanapes from the city—a pauper without
a dollar to support his wife on, sir,
and yet it lacks only a few days of the
time set for my marriage to that saucy
girl, and, mind you, if the ceremony is not
pulled off in due time, I’ll lose not a day,
I swear, in foreclosing the mortgage.”</p>

<p>It was in vain that Wizard Hermann
tried to pacify him, saying that he would
certainly keep his promise, and that he
was sure that there was some mistake
about Leola’s engagement to young Chester,
who was almost a stranger.</p>

<p>But at this point Bennett produced his
proof in the shape of Leola’s letter to Ray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span></p>

<p>“This is worse than I thought, but it
does not alter the fact that the girl shall
be your wife, Bennett, for I have sworn to
keep my promise, and I will not fail you,
by Heaven!” vowed Hermann, continuing:</p>

<p>“As for neglecting to get matters into
shape, that is false, for I have been quietly
working to the promised end all these
weeks, but, having encountered such determined
opposition from the girl, I
thought it expedient not to press her too
hard, but to depend on force and cunning,
since fair means failed. In fact, one of
my objects in going to New York was to
enlist the aid of my clever half-sister, Mrs.
Stirling, in accomplishing the end in view.
She will arrive with her daughter this
morning, and although I admit that the
case looks unpromising now, I believe we
will soon wind a web around Leola from
which she cannot escape. Go home, Bennett,
and rest easy in the thought that
before the end of a week she will be your
charming bride.”</p>

<p>The prospective bridegroom beamed with
joy and assured Hermann that he was
ready to co-operate in any plan proposed
for Leola’s subjugation.</p>

<p>“I will go to any length now to punish
her for her contempt, and for advising me
to marry a skinny old maid like Amanda
Tuttle when I’m rich enough to buy a
lovely young girl for a bride!” he vowed,
coarsely, and took leave with renewed
hope.</p>

<p>In the hall, as he was going out, he encountered
Miss Tuttle, and fancied she
might have been eavesdropping from her
air of confusion, but he stalked past her
with a curt nod that cut to her tender
heart like a knife.</p>

<p>“Oh, what has come over him when he
used to be so friendly? Can it be that he
is angry at Leola’s suggestion that he
should court me?” sighed the poor thing,
deprecatingly.</p>

<p>It would have been well indeed if she
had been listening, as Bennett suspected,
for then she might have been able to inform
Leola of the perils that threatened
her in the joining of forces of Wizard
Hermann and his worldly-wise sister, but
she had only been loitering about the hall
in hopes of a little interview when he
came out, and tears of disappointment
brimmed over in her kind gray eyes, when
he passed her with so indifferent a greeting.</p>

<p>As she followed to the door and watched
him galloping away toward home, she saw
the carriage coming with the Stirlings, and
ran to tell Leola the news.</p>

<h3>WHAT THE ROBINS HEARD.</h3>


<p>By-and-by, when Jessie removed the dust
of travel, and freshened herself up with
a dainty blue gown that just matched her
sky-blue eyes, the two girls strolled out
upon the lawn, and presently found seats
in the favorite rose-arbor, where the robins,
nesting overhead, made a mighty
twittering in vain protest against their
unwelcome intrusion.</p>

<p>“It is because you are a stranger, Jessie,”
laughed Leola. “It is quite different
when Ray and I come here together—they
treat us quite as if we belonged to the
Robin family.”</p>

<p>“Who is Ray?” asked Jessie, curiously.</p>

<p>Leola could not help blushing furiously,
but she said, as carelessly as she could:</p>

<p>“Oh, only one of our neighbors!”</p>

<p>She was inwardly furious with herself at
this slip of the tongue that was destined
to lead her into self-betrayal. Ah, how
true it is that a name that is close to the
heart must often rise to the lips.</p>

<p>To distract Jessie’s attention she asked,
all in a breath:</p>

<p>“When are you going to marry your
grand, rich lover, Jessie?”</p>

<p>“My wedding will be in October,” fibbed
Miss Stirling, who had no mind to confess
that she had lost the prize, and she continued:</p>

<p>“Mr. Olyphant has gone on a yachting
tour with some friends now, and I do not
know exactly when they will return. It
was expected they would only be gone two
weeks, but they extended the trip. I miss
him very much, and I shall be quite frantic
if he stays much longer!”</p>

<p>“Then you love him very much?” queried
Leola, with shining eyes.</p>

<p>“Love him! I should say so!” cried
Jessie, eagerly. “Why, Leola, he is as
handsome as a picture, tall, with an elegant
figure, fine features, brown, curly
hair, and beautiful, laughing blue eyes!”</p>

<p>“So has Ray!” cried Leola, then bit her
lips in confusion, sighing to herself:</p>

<p>“What a lovesick little goose I am, giving
away my dangerous secret in spite of
myself!”</p>

<p>“Ray again!” cried Jessie, suspiciously.
“Come, now, tell me all about him, Leola.
A neighbor, you said, but I knew no one
of that name about here last summer. You
say he has laughing blue eyes like Chester
Olyphant, so you must be fond of him, this
neighbor! Confess now, is he your lover?”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense, Jessie, we were talking of
your lover!” cried Leola. “Go on, please,
tell me more of him, and of your love for
each other.”</p>

<p>“We are perfectly devoted to each other,”
declared Jessie, unblushingly. “How could
I help loving him—with all that money!”</p>

<p>“But, Jessie, if Mr. Olyphant were poor,
would you not love him just the same?”</p>

<p>Jessie had a red rose in her hand, and
she tore it to pieces with absent-minded
fingers as she replied, bluntly:</p>

<p>“Bah. I wouldn’t permit myself to love a
poor man if he were a perfect Adonis!”</p>

<p>But artless Leola, with rosy cheeks and
glowing eyes, retorted:</p>

<p>“Then you do not know how to love,
Jessie—not even the meaning of that sacred
word, for I would adore Ray Chester if he
had not a second coat to his back!”</p>

<p>“Ray Chester! There you go again!”
cried Miss Stirling, with a violent start.
“Oh, come now, you are madly in love
with some man, Leola, and you have got
to tell me all about it this minute!”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are mistaken!” cried poor Leola,
trying to flounder out of her difficulty.</p>

<p>“I am not mistaken! Oh, no! I know
all the signs of love, and you cannot even
keep his name off your lips!” cried Miss
Stirling, triumphantly:</p>

<p>It was true: Leola realized it, and felt
how impossible it was to keep hidden the
happy secret of her love. Indeed, she
fairly ached to tell it to some sweet, sympathetic
girl friend, and why not Jessie,
whom she had known from childhood, and
who had always been fairly friendly? True;
the young lady was twenty-three, four
years older than herself, but as each was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
madly in love with a splendid young man,
there was a bond of sympathy between
their hearts that might bring good results
if they fairly understood each other.</p>

<p>She suddenly made up her artless mind
to confide in beautiful, blue-eyed Jessie,
and beg her to intercede with her guardian
to consent to her happiness, but because
tears were very close to her own dark eyes,
she put Ray aside for a moment to recover
herself, saying, laughingly:</p>

<p>“Only think, Jessie, I have a rich lover,
too. Our neighbor, Giles Bennett, who has
gotten rich by coal since his wife died,
wants to marry me, the little girl he used
to dandle on his knee! Now, what do you
think of that?”</p>

<p>“A splendid match for you, Leola, and I
hope you will accept him,” declared Jessie,
frankly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, no!” Leola cried out, quickly,
and Jessie retorted:</p>

<p>“More fool you, then, to let such a
chance slip through your fingers! If I
weren’t going to marry Chester Olyphant
I’d take old Fatty off your hands myself.
But it seems, from what you let slip just
now, that there’s a poor young man in the
case—Ray Chester, you said, and if you do
not tell me the whole story instantly I
shall die of curiosity!”</p>

<p>Leola, with her beautiful face glowing
like a rose, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“I don’t want you to die, Jessie, so I am
going to ‘’fess,’ as the children say, and,
after all, I think I ought to confide in you,
for it is through you all this happiness has
come to me.”</p>

<p>“Through me,” gasped Jessie, and her
lips went white, while a cold hand seemed
to press all the life from her heart with
a swift, horrible suspicion that centered
around that name “Chester,” breathed so
sweetly just now from Leola’s lovely lips.</p>

<p>But Leola did not observe these signs of
emotion. She was looking down, bashfully,
and playing with a bunch of red roses in
the belt of her simple white gown. Her
beauty was glorified by the love that
thrilled at her heart.</p>

<p>“I will begin at the beginning first of all,
and tell you how I saved Ray Chester’s
life,” she said, softly, and, as before, her
voice seemed to linger over that name like
a caress.</p>

<p>Miss Stirling did not answer a word. She
sat still and pale, listening, with a horrible
presentiment of what was coming, and a
hatred for innocent Leola, a jealous hatred
that was more bitter than death.</p>

<p>Leola, still playing with her roses, in
bashful confusion, looked down with the
curly lashes sweeping her rosy cheeks, and
told her story briefly, sweetly, and with the
simplicity of strong emotion, dwelling but
lightly on her own heroism in saving Ray
Chester’s life, and touching, reservedly, on
their love-story, but bringing into prominence
his confession that he had fallen
so desperately in love with her pictures
that he had come to seek her and offer
his love.</p>

<p>She concluded, gently:</p>

<p>“And although Ray has never once mentioned
your name, he did not deny it when
I said that I was sure it was you from
whom he got the pictures; and, Jessie,
dear, I am so glad you took those little
snap-shots of me, for through them has
come the happiness of my life, and I shall
always be glad Ray saw them and loved
me!”</p>

<p>The musical voice ceased speaking, but
as Jessie made no answer, Leola added,
ardently:</p>

<p>“He is only a poor artist, my darling
Ray, but I am glad, after all, that he is
poor, for he knows I love him for himself
alone, for ‘his own true worth,’ as the
poem says, you know, Jessie.”</p>

<p>She gave a violent start when Miss Stirling
answered, in a hoarse, concentrated
voice of hatred and bitterness:</p>

<p>“You are a silly little fool, Leola Mead!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jessie!” and Leola’s voice trembled
with wounded feeling.</p>

<p>She looked up and saw that her companion
was deadly pale and trembling.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is the matter? Are you ill,
Jessie? Have I wearied you with my
story?”</p>

<p>Miss Stirling was very cunning, or very
brave. She had got a heart wound, but
she would not cry out against the hand
that struck the blow; after that one passionate
outburst she struggled for calmness.</p>

<p>With a hollow laugh, she answered:</p>

<p>“I am very, very tired, after my long
journey from New York, and the sun is
very hot, but—I shall be better presently.”</p>

<p>“Shall I go and bring you a little sip of
wine?” urged Leola, and Jessie assented.</p>

<p>She was glad to be alone for one moment,
to cry out aloud at the fate that had
parted her from the man she loved.</p>

<p>“Mamma was right, and I was wrong.
He was in love with her, after all, and he
came here, instead of going yachting, as he
intended—came here to woo this simple
rustic, won by her wondrous beauty, that
was more dangerous than I dreamed! But
he shall never marry Leola Mead—never!
Why, I think I would murder her first!
And what will he say when he finds me
here? Above all, why is he masquerading
under a false name, and pretending to be
a poor artist? Ah, I have it! He means to
deceive the silly girl; his intentions are dishonorable,
but I will unmask him, I will
break up the affair, I swear it!” clenching
her white hands desperately.</p>

<p>Leola came back with the wine and a
biscuit, and Jessie accepted, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Wine always clears my brain, somehow,
and I have got a lot of scheming and
planning to do,” she thought, as she
drained the last drop and munched the
sweet biscuit.</p>

<p>“Ah, you look better now. I am afraid
it quite unnerved you, hearing all about
that accident to Ray,” exclaimed Leola,
tenderly.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, it was dreadful; it made my
flesh creep. Besides, I was very tired,
you know, and that made it worse; but I
am ever so much better now, thanks to the
wine! Really, Leola, you were quite a
heroine, and I cannot wonder that my
artist friend fell in love with you, though
I cannot, for the life of me, remember any
man by that name, Ray Chester. I know
I loaned your pictures to my lover, Chester
Olyphant, but it cannot be that he came
here to deceive a poor innocent country
girl because of her pretty face—oh no! I
cannot believe that of my lover. It is a
good thing I came in time to thwart his
evil designs, if he really is my Chester,
but—ah!” She looked up, wildly, for a
man’s step crunched on the ground, and
the next moment he stepped into the arbor—Ray
Chester, or Ray Olyphant, cool,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
handsome, smiling, like the villain in the
play.</p>

<p>Miss Stirling sprang to her feet with a
thrilling cry. The next moment she flung
herself on his broad breast, her arms about
his neck, crying joyously:</p>

<p>“Chester Olyphant, my own darling,
naughty, runaway boy!”</p>

</div>

<h3>CHESTER OLYPHANT’S CURSE.</h3>


<p>Had an earthquake rent the solid ground
beneath Leola’s feet she could not have
been more terribly shocked.</p>

<p>She had listened in horror, with a wildly
palpitating heart, to the words that slipped
from Miss Stirling’s cruel lips—listened,
with the blood leaping like fire through her
veins, to the suspicions suggested so coolly;
but at the sudden and startling finale,
when her rival sprang joyously to the
breast of her lover—at this shocking finale,
Leola’s blood, from coursing like liquid fire
through her veins, swiftly congealed to ice,
her face went white as snow, her heart
stopped its wild pulsations, and she sank
upon the ground, limply, like one dead.</p>

<p>And overhead the sun shone on in the
clear blue sky, and the merry robins sang
among the roses as if love and life had not
seemingly come to an end together for
stricken Leola.</p>

<p>But if that terrible swoon had not overtaken
her at that crucial moment, Leola
would have seen her lover recoil in anger
from Jessie’s embrace, and push her gently
but decisively away, saying, rebukingly:</p>

<p>“Miss Stirling, pray remember that our
brief engagement ended long ago, and that
this advance on your part is in the worst
possible taste.”</p>

<p>If she had been conscious, instead of
lying like a dead girl on the ground amid
the ruins of her happiness, she would have
seen Jessie Stirling sink down and clasp
Chester’s knees, and with burning tears
beseech him to love her again because she
could not endure life without him.</p>

<p>She would have heard these passionate
prayers repulsed; she would have heard
Chester Olyphant saying, coldly:</p>

<p>“Words are useless, Miss Stirling, for,
after all, I never really loved you, and you
entrapped me somehow into an engagement
that my heart never sanctioned. The
glamour of passion quickly faded, and
when your own folly gave me an excuse
to gain an honorable release from fetters
that began to gall, I was glad to retreat
with honor. I have to tell you things thus
frankly, because it is the only way out of
your efforts at a reconciliation that can
never be effected, since my whole heart is
given to another.”</p>

<p>All the while he was unconscious of
Leola, lying there like a dead girl on the
ground, and he continued, impatiently:</p>

<p>“Pray get up, Miss Stirling; it is embarrassing
to have you kneel to me. Be
seated, I beg you, and calm yourself. This
is certainly a very unexpected rencontre. I
did not know you were at Wheatlands. Has
not Leola, then, told you she is my promised
wife?”</p>

<p>Sinking, sullenly, to the arbor bench as
he raised her to her feet, she hissed,
furiously:</p>

<p>“The silly little rustic told me she was
in love with a man named Ray Chester,
but how was I to guess that her poor
artist lover was the millionaire society
man, Chester Olyphant, masquerading under
a false name and guise, perhaps to
deceive a pretty, ignorant country girl,
with more beauty than brains?”</p>

<p>He recoiled in horror from her bold accusation,
his handsome face went white,
his blue eyes flashed lightning.</p>

<p>“How dare you?” he thundered, clenching
his fist; then it fell helplessly to his
side. “You are a woman; I cannot strike
you. I can only reason and explain.”</p>

<p>“Yes, explain, if you can, for your conduct
certainly appears very suspicious,”
Jessie Stirling answered, with a bitter,
taunting laugh that nearly drove him wild.</p>

<p>And yet, in all his anger, he knew she
was right; it did look bad, this masquerade;
and, although he despised the girl,
he knew he must explain for Leola’s sake.</p>

<p>Still unconscious that his bonny sweetheart
lay upon the ground, so close that
if he stepped backward he must stumble
over her senseless form, he glanced out of
the arbor to see if she were coming, and
then turned back to Jessie, saying, hoarsely:</p>

<p>“It looks suspicious, I grant you, but
when a man is cursed with immense wealth,
and knows himself constantly the prey
of designing women wanting to marry him
for his money, is it not excusable that,
by a little harmless deception, he may win
a girl’s heart by love alone, and thus ensure
his future happiness?”</p>

<p>“Bah! a slim excuse!” she sneered; but,
restraining his resentment, he continued,
earnestly:</p>

<p>“This, I swear to you, Miss Stirling, was
my only reason for the little deception I
practised on Leola, and my plan succeeded
well. I have won for my own the sweetest,
truest heart that ever beat, and I had
decided last night to come here to-day to
confess all to Leola and her guardian, and
to press for an immediate marriage, in
order to save her from the persecutions of
a rich old man, who has Mr. Hermann in
his power, by reason of a mortgage on his
property. It was my design to relieve his
embarrassment by advancing the amount
myself to pay off the mortgage. I hope
you will accept this truthful explanation,
and forego the gratification of your unwise
spite by any persecution of my dear little
love, Leola, whom I must now seek.”</p>

<p>“You will not have far to seek. Look behind
you on the ground!” Miss Stirling
answered, with a bitter laugh.</p>

<p>Then for the first time he became aware
of Leola’s presence—Leola lying like a
dead girl on the ground at his feet.</p>

<p>In the one moment that he stood gazing
down like a statue of despair, Miss Stirling
cried, with triumphant malice:</p>

<p>“Just before you came in Leola and I
had had a very satisfactory explanation,
for I recognized you in her description,
and I soon made her understand your villainy.
Yes, I told her you were betrothed
to me, and that you were deceiving her.
She believed me, and despised you, and
just at the moment of her outcry against
you, when you entered and I sprang to
your breast, claiming you for my own,
she dropped like one with a bullet in her
heart, and there she has been lying ever
since, and more than likely the poor, deceived
girl is really dead of the shock.”</p>

<p>“Fiend!” he hurled at her, bitterly, and
sank on his knees by Leola, frantically
searching for signs of life, kissing her
cold, white face, calling on her in love’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
holy name to waken for his sake, and
speak to him again.</p>

<p>Jessie Stirling, listening with outward
cold indifference, prayed that Leola would
never answer those vows of love, never
open her sweet dark eyes again, prayed
that death might indeed claim her for his
own.</p>

<p>And she smiled when all his efforts and
all caresses proved vain to bring life back
to the stricken girl—smiled even when he
turned to her with accusing eyes and cried
in bitter agony:</p>

<p>“Your false words have broken my little
love’s heart, and slain her as surely as if
you had struck a dagger into her breast!
You have murdered an innocent girl who
never wronged you, Jessie Stirling, yet you
sit there and smile like the fiend you are!
Do you think you can ever know any happiness
after this? No, for my hate will
follow you through life, and my curse will
darken your days and make sleepless your
nights till you pray for death’s release!”</p>

<p>He ceased and turned back to Leola,
kissing her cold face and hands with burning
lips, then lifting the inert form in his
arms, he bore her toward the house, Jessie
Stirling following in a sort of awe, mixed
with rage and revolt against the curse he
had pronounced against her, wondering
if there could be any fateful occult power
to cause its fulfillment.</p>

<p>With a heart as heavy as lead, Chester
Olyphant bore his burden up the steps to
the hall, where Miss Tuttle met him,
shrieking:</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven have mercy, what has happened
to Leola?”</p>

<p>She was appalled when he groaned in anguish:</p>

<p>“Alas, I found her dead in the arbor.
Lead the way to her room.”</p>

<p>“Not dead, oh, no, it cannot be! Surely
it is only a faint! Come this way,” sobbed
the governess, and in a few moments Leola
was placed on her little white bed among
the dainty pillows, no whiter than her
face.</p>

<p>Miss Tuttle felt for her heart, but there
was no faintest throb to give hope of life.</p>

<p>“Oh, bring a doctor, do bring a doctor,
Mr. Chester! I cannot surely believe she
is dead. Once I saw her lie like this half
an hour when she had fallen from a horse,
and she may revive this time, too. Oh,
please, please bring Doctor Barnes at
once!” she exclaimed, excitedly, and, as
he flew to do her bidding, she fell to undressing
the girl, tenderly, but swiftly,
saying to Jessie, who stood near, looking
on, stupidly:</p>

<p>“Run, run to the kitchen and tell Betsy
I must have some warm water for a bath
for Leola. She may be in a sort of spasm.”</p>

<p>Jessie Stirling ran out of the room, but
she did not carry the message to the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Instead she sought her uncle, to whom
she said, with an injured air:</p>

<p>“Oh, Uncle Hermann. I’m so glad I
came this morning, for I have detected a
villain in a plot to ruin poor Leola! You
remember how I told you I was betrothed
to Chester Olyphant, a millionaire of New
York, and that he was gone on a yachting
tour for a few weeks. Well, this morning I
found that, instead of going yachting, as
he pretended, the unprincipled villain, who
knew of Leola from me, had come down
here masquerading as Ray Chester, an
artist, making love to poor, innocent Leola.
This morning he came upon us in the
arbor, and when I exposed him to the
girl, she fell in a swoon so deep that it
looks like death.”</p>

<p>A bitter oath shrilled over Wizard Hermann’s
lips, and he cried:</p>

<p>“Where is he, the villain? Let me get
my hands on his throat!”</p>

<p>“He is gone to bring Doctor Barnes,
uncle, but he will be back with him presently,
and were I you, dear uncle, I should
wreak vengeance on the wretch for his
double treachery—to me, his betrothed, and
to poor, innocent Leola, whom he has deceived
with his false protestations of love.
You need not fear to anger me, for I will
never marry him now; I hate him for
his treachery,” raged the artful girl, and
her uncle responded:</p>

<p>“I’ll throw him down the steps and
break every bone in his body, if he ventures
back here. But Leola is lying unconscious,
you say. Have they brought
her into the house?”</p>

<p>“Yes, she is in her room, and her governess
with her. I daresay she will revive
presently, and as I cannot do anything
more for her I’ll go help mamma to unpack
our trunks, while you watch for the doctor
and that wretch, Chester Olyphant.”</p>

<p>And hoping in the bottom of her heart
that not a bone would be left unbroken
in the young man’s body, hating him because
he knew her for what she was, and
because she could never win him back
again, she flew to her mother to relate all
that had occurred.</p>

<p>“I told you so. I knew that day that
Chester Olyphant was struck with the
girl, and wanted to find her out, but you
would not listen to me, and now you have
lost him forever,” was her comment.</p>

<p>“Oh, I knew you’d have to go over all
that, but even if I had known it, how
could I have helped it?” was the ungracious
reply.</p>

<p>“Then, what do you want me to do?”
asked the querulous mother, and she
quailed when Jessie whispered in her ear:</p>

<p>“I want you to go and help Miss Tuttle
to revive Leola—that is, to pretend to, but
really to see that she stays dead, for it
would be joy to me to see Chester Olyphant
bereaved of his love.”</p>

<p>“Jessie, you are mad, girl! I cannot aid
you in such a nefarious design,” cried the
poor, nervous mother, trembling as with
a chill.</p>

<p>“Then I will manage it myself!” Jessie
hissed, rushing madly from the room to
Leola’s bedside.</p>

<p>But Miss Tuttle gently barred her from
the door.</p>

<p>“Doctor Barnes is here, and he will not
permit anyone in the room but myself, not
even her betrothed,” she said, curtly, shutting
the door calmly in Jessie’s very face.</p>

<h3>A TERRIBLE DEED.</h3>


<p>Wizard Hermann turned about, half-stunned
from his interview with Jessie
Stirling, and went back to his laboratory,
where he had been reading a new treatise
on one of his favorite hobbies—the transmutation
of the baser metals into gold.
The man had no more heart or conscience
than a clam, and his interest in chemistry
was greater than his love for humanity.</p>

<p>The greatest aim he had in life was to
prosecute to a successful issue the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
hobbies that had been the ruling passion
of his life, to invent a magic elixir of life,
and to create fabulous riches to sustain a
life so lengthened in luxury.</p>

<p>He was mad for gold wherewith to purchase
the smallest specimen of a newly
discovered mineral called radium, to which
was ascribed the most remarkable properties
ever heard of, but the price of this
treasure was fabulous to a man in his
situation, impoverished by a lifetime spent
in this costly and vain pursuit of the unattainable.</p>

<p>His great plan and hope had been to pay
off the mortgage on the place, and to immediately
place another upon it, so as to
invest a portion in the new mineral, from
which so much was hoped and predicted in
the scientific world.</p>

<p>His rage at the failure of his plan was
deep and bitter. With Leola dead, all his
plans would come to naught. Old Bennett
would foreclose the mortgage and ruin him.
In his old age he must go forth a beggar
into the world, friendless, and without a
place to lay his head.</p>

<p>Through this terrible trick of fate all his
plans and aspirations must be wrecked,
and science lose, perhaps, the magnificent
discoveries to which he had devoted his
life.</p>

<p>No wonder he was filled with a blind
fury against Chester Olyphant, through
whose treachery Leola’s death had come
to pass, thus thwarting all his plans for
future gain.</p>

<p>He shut the treatise, whose reading had
been so fatefully interrupted, and went out
to watch for Chester Olyphant with murder
in his heart.</p>

<p>But while he had been talking with
Jessie, and putting away his precious
treatise, time had slipped faster than he
knew. Olyphant, who had met the doctor
close by in the road, had quickly returned
with him, and he had gone up to Leola’s
room.</p>

<p>The young man, himself a prey to the
bitterest anxiety, with hope and fear commingled,
was waiting in the wide, sunny
hall for news, when he came face to face
with the grim master of the house, like a
ravening lion seeking for prey.</p>

<p>He forced a smile upon his pallid lips,
and exclaimed, eagerly:</p>

<p>“Ah. Mr. Hermann, I have been wishing
to see you, sir. I”—</p>

<p>He got no further, for Wizard Hermann,
temporarily mad with baffled hope and
bitter resentment, suddenly raised his
hand, in whose clenched fingers gleamed a
heavy iron instrument, and in an access of
fury struck unerringly at the brown, curly
head bent courteously before him.</p>

<p>It was a blow that might have felled an
ox.</p>

<p>Chester Olyphant, taken off guard, ignorant
of the fact that he was in the presence
of one temporarily or morally insane,
received the blow full, and went down before
it without a struggle, yielding up life
in one short, choking gasp, that was like
a thunder-clap in the ears of his foe.</p>

<p>For, all in a moment, there came over
the frenzied murderer a wild realization
of his deadly crime, and bending down to
peer at the still, white face of the fallen
man, he groaned in horror of his sin and
its consequences:</p>

<p>“Dead! dead! Why, I did not mean to
strike so hard! I—I—never thought one
blow could kill! What shall I do? No one
must find me here. I must fly”—</p>

<p>At this incoherent moment, while he was
rising from the body of his victim, there
came slouching through the wide, sunny
hall the figure of his man of all work,
Joslyn, a strange, hideous, taciturn man,
yet devoted to his master’s service through
many thankless years.</p>

<p>Joslyn stopped and stared in bewilderment,
glaring at the uncanny scene.</p>

<p>Wizard Hermann, peering up at him in
consternation, whimpered like a beaten
hound:</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to hit so hard. He—he—was
too easy to kill! If they find me here
they’ll hang me for murder! Save me!
save me! Joslyn!”</p>

<p>The hideous servitor, conscious of but
one thing—his master’s peril—was quick to
hear and heed.</p>

<p>At any moment some one might come in
at the open door, and one glance meant
detection of the hideous crime his master
had wrought.</p>

<p>Joslyn looked stupid, but his master knew
it was only in looks. His brain was keen
and alert, as he had proved many a time
before.</p>

<p>Just one moment he paused, hesitated;
then his dull eyes gleamed beneath the
bushy brows, and he was prepared for
action.</p>

<p>They were just in front of the library
door, and, swooping down like an eagle on
his prey, he caught up Chester Olyphant’s
limp body in his long, wiry arms, and
dragged him inside the room. Hermann
staggered after him with quaking limbs
and a ghastly face; then Joslyn softly shut
and locked the door.</p>

<p>The two old men, who had grown gray
in each other’s confidence and service—grim
old men, who had outgrown pity or
interest in youth and love and all that was
sweetest in the world, now stood face to
face, and between them, on the floor, that
limp body that, now cold and senseless, had
been but a little while ago a picture of
manly strength and splendor, with a heart
throbbing fast with the passion of youth.</p>

<p>“Who saw you do it?” Joslyn demanded,
gruffly.</p>

<p>“Not a soul!” whimpered the craven
wretch. “You see, I did it in a passion
before I thought, because he”—</p>

<p>But Joslyn’s coarse, hairy hand, upraised,
commanded silence.</p>

<p>“Don’t waste time now to tell why ’twas
done. The thing is that you did it, and
that you must hide it or swing for it,” he
said, with rough emphasis that made his
master cower again like a beaten hound.</p>

<p>The servant knelt down and examined
the silent victim.</p>

<p>“Dead as a door-nail, an’ gittin’ cold
a’ready! You hit him a turrible whack,
sir, on his head! Must have fractured his
skull, the way it feels.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know I had such strength. I
hit harder than I meant. I—I”—began
Hermann, weakly, but the man shut him
off.</p>

<p>“No use cryin’ over spilt milk. What’s
done is done, an’ now we got to hide the
corp, an’ let it go as one of the myster’ous
disappearances we read about every week
in the newspapers!”</p>

<p>“Joslyn, how clever you are! Oh, if we
can only manage it! But I cannot think
clearly. My brain’s on fire ever since
Jessie came with her terrible story, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
tempted me to kill him because of the
hearts he had broken—hers and Leola’s,
too, so that she wanted vengeance on him
for their wrongs. So I seized that iron
wedge and went to watch for him, and
the minute he spoke to me I struck, and
he fell. He’s dead, and he deserved it. I
am not sorry, only I don’t want to be found
out,” Hermann mumbled on, unheeded by
the other, who stood with his brows
wrinkled in profound thought.</p>

<p>He chuckled, suddenly, and Hermann
muttered:</p>

<p>“You have a thought, clever Joslyn; you
will save me!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, sir, if I can work out my
plan.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes?”</p>

<p>“You know what’s under this floor, sir?”</p>

<p>“The underground passage where my ancestors
used to hide from the Indians—yes,
yes. Can we drop him through?”</p>

<p>“Sure, if I can get the tools in here to
rip up some flooring and put it back. Will
you stay here, locked in, while I push them
into the window, for I daren’t bring them
into the hall.”</p>

<p>“Yes, go, quickly,” and he let him out
and closed and locked the door again, waiting,
with a chill of horror at his heart, of
that white and silent thing lying at his
feet.</p>

<p>Presently there was a noise outside the
window, and he went and took in the tools
that Joslyn reached up to him. Then he
admitted him, and they went at their
grewsome work of hiding the mute witness
of that terrible crime.</p>

<p>In the midst of their task came a light
rap on the door.</p>

<p>“Uncle Hermann, I want you!” Jessie
said, excitedly.</p>

<p>“I am engaged—excuse me,” he bawled,
hoarsely, through the keyhole.</p>

<p>“All right,” she answered, after a moment’s
hesitation; “I only wanted to tell
you about Leola. Doctor Barnes says she
is not dead, after all, and he is bringing
her around; do you hear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hear, Jessie. Now go away, like
a good girl; I cannot be disturbed,” he
assured her, turning back to Joslyn in
time to see him lift Chester Olyphant’s
body and let it fall through the opening in
the floor.</p>

</div>

<p>Leola sat up in bed among the white
covers, scarcely whiter than her face, and
smiled wanly into Miss Tuttle’s anxious
eyes.</p>

<p>“I am sorry that I am better. I wish I
had died,” she said, bitterly.</p>

<p>For twenty-four hours she had been
threatened with brain fever, but now the
crisis had passed, and she was improving.</p>

<p>Doctor Barnes, who had been very uneasy
all this time, had said just now she
would soon be well—that her youth and
fine constitution had tided her safely over
the danger point.</p>

<p>These two days Miss Tuttle had nursed
her most carefully, admitting, by the doctor’s
orders, no one but himself.</p>

<p>In vain Jessie Stirling pleaded to come
in and help nurse the patient; Miss Tuttle
sent her ruthlessly away.</p>

<p>“Doctor Barnes exacts perfect quiet, and
trusts her only to me,” she said, proudly.</p>

<p>Jessie retired, baffled and angry, to cogitate
over the mystery of Chester Olyphant’s
disappearance.</p>

<p>For since he had gone to bring the doctor
to Leola, no one had seen his face.</p>

<p>Jessie had by no means expected him to
retreat from the field of battle. Instead,
she had looked for him to march off with
victory on his banners, the battle gained,
the prize won. She knew that if Chester
could get an opportunity to tell her uncle
that he was rich and would pay off the
mortgage on Wheatlands, he could easily
gain his ends and marry Leola.</p>

<p>It was in dread of this that she had incited
him to anger against Chester, hoping
to prevent their coming to an understanding.</p>

<p>But Chester’s unexplained disappearance
had startled and surprised everyone, for
only this morning Mrs. Gray, the widow at
whose cottage home he boarded, had come
to Wheatlands to seek him, saying he had
not been back for two days.</p>

<p>Diligent inquiry revealed the fact that
Doctor Barnes was the last person who
had seen him at all, having left him alone
in the hall the day he had brought him
to see Leola.</p>

<p>Widow Gray was quite alarmed, and did
not know what to think.</p>

<p>“He certainly expected to return, for he
did not take his trunk away,” she said,
but Mr. Hermann made light of the matter.</p>

<p>“Go home, and don’t worry—he has perhaps
been called away by a telegram, and
will be back in due time,” he said.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I hope so, sir. He was a very
fine young man, and I hope he has come to
no harm,” she protested.</p>

<p>And again the wizard laughed:</p>

<p>“How could he come to harm in broad
daylight in my house?”</p>

<p>“That’s so, sir; I don’t see how he could
indeed, but I hope I shall hear from him
soon, for I had bad dreams last night, and
my mind misgives me,” she sighed.</p>

<p>Then she asked if she might see the
sick girl, but was told she was too ill.
Thereupon she went away, sighing, with
a very long face, saying to herself:</p>

<p>“If I had told that horrid old man he
would not have believed me, but last night
I heard spirit voices sobbing in the pine
tree outside my window, and whenever I
hear that, it’s a sure sign of trouble.”</p>

<p>While she went slowly out of the gate
Miss Tuttle was watching her from the
window, and she said to the pale girl sitting
back among the pillows:</p>

<p>“There goes Mrs. Gray. I suppose she
has been to inquire about you.”</p>

<p>Leola’s wistful eyes looked at her with
a mute question, and she answered, gently:</p>

<p>“You’re thinking of Mr. Chester Olyphant,
I know, dearie, and I had better tell
you and get it off your mind. He has gone
away.”</p>

<p>“Gone away!” Leola repeated, trembling,
her lips white, her eyes somber with misery.</p>

<p>“Yes, gone away, and a good riddance,
I say, for how could he face you again
after all that has happened? He has nearly
broken Miss Stirling’s heart as well as
yours, and she vows she will never speak
to him again for your sake! Only think
of the great monster, engaged to her, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
coming off down here to make love to you,
because you were so pretty and so innocent.
There was not a word he could say
in his own defence, nothing but to sneak
away like a hound beaten for stealing!
Yes, he is gone, and I hope that is the
last of him!”</p>

<p>Leola’s white, trembling hands hid her
face, but presently she spoke wearily
through her fingers:</p>

<p>“I have just one favor to ask you, dear
Miss Tuttle. Never mention his name to
me again, so that I may find it easier to
forget.”</p>

<p>Alas, would she find oblivion of pain so
easily?</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To her own heart the unhappy girl was
saying:</p>

<p>“Oh, why did I not die when I found that
he was false, and my dream of love over?
Why linger on when the charm is gone
from life, and I must live on, shamed,
humiliated, by the thought that Jessie
Stirling’s proud, rich lover stooped from
the height where he should dwell to pluck
a wayside flower, then trample it beneath
his feet? Oh, it is torture to think he held
me so lightly!”</p>

<h3>IN THE SPIDER’S WEB.</h3>


<p>She wondered that she did not die of her
shame and despair, so keen was her pain
and humiliation, but the day wore to sunset
and she was still alive, although the
face of the whole world had changed to
her in twenty-four hours, so that the blue
of the sky and the gold of the sun no
longer seemed fair, and the birdsongs in
the trees outside had changed to notes of
sadness that fell coldly on her heart.</p>

<p>There came to her a sharp memory of
the little song she had once loved, the one
that had lingered on her lips the day she
rode so blithely away on Rex to meet her
fate in the beautiful dark blue eyes that
had been so false and fair:</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I am going to let you sit in this easy-chair
by the window to watch the beautiful
July sunset, and Mr. Hermann wants
to come in and see you,” Miss Tuttle said,
placing the chair ready and dressing her
patient in a soft white wrapper.</p>

<p>But it was Jessie Stirling who pushed
open the door and tripped in, first taking
advantage of its being unlocked.</p>

<p>“Poor dear, how changed you look, how
pale, how ill! It was a terrible shock to
you to find out how Chester Olyphant had
deceived you, was it not?” she twittered,
loquaciously, coolly taking a chair in front
of Leola, and adding:</p>

<p>“You may well fancy it was a shock to
me, too, to find him down here flirting
with you when I thought him safe on a
yacht thousands of miles away. Did Miss
Tuttle tell you he has gone away in a
huff at being found out, and without leaving
any word for me? Yes, he has gone,
and at first I vowed I never would forgive
him his flirtation with you, but—well, when
I go back to New York perhaps I will relent,
after he has coaxed long enough.
We really are very fond of each other, you
know, though Chester cannot help flirting
any more than he can help breathing. I
shall never let him know how hard you
took it, for that would flatter his vanity
too much!”</p>

<p>His vanity, dear heaven! and she had
believed he loved her, thought Leola, with
silent shame and despair.</p>

<p>She could not bear to look at Jessie, his
jubilant betrothed, sitting there in her
pretty fashionable gown and fluffy flaxen
locks in a wavy aureole over her white
brow. She wished secretly that the girl
would go away and leave her alone with
her wounded heart.</p>

<p>But Jessie went on, eagerly:</p>

<p>“When I consent to forgive him for this
I shall scold him roundly, you may be sure,
Leola, and I shall pretend to him that
after that little fainting fit you came
around all right, and despised him for his
duplicity, and vowed you would never see
him again. He shall not think, the vain
creature, that you wore the willow an hour
for his sake. I will pretend you had other
lovers to take his place. That will be true,
for there is Mr. Bennett, who adores you,
although you have flouted him so badly.
As for me, if I were in your place I’d
marry Bennett out of hand, to show
Chester Olyphant how little I cared about
him! That would take the conceit out of
him quicker than anything you could do!”</p>

<p>So she twittered on artfully until Leola’s
lovely face grew crimson with shame at
her own weakness in caring so much for
one so unworthy.</p>

<p>Without saying one word, her somber
eyes turned to the setting sun; she writhed
with secret shame that Jessie could think
she cared so much for her frivolous lover.
Oh, if she could only tear this pain from
her heart; only smile again as before this
cruel blow that had nearly struck her
dead with its agony.</p>

<p>As Jessie chattered on, she began to feel
a passionate contempt for the man as the
pretty blonde depicted him, shallow, vain,
unscrupulous.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Shall it not be scorn to me to harp on such a mouldering string:</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>With sudden angry passion, her dark
eyes flashing, she turned upon the artful
girl:</p>

<p>“Please speak no more to me on that
subject, Jessie. You weary me. I despise
the man. I wish never to hear his name
again!” she cried, bitterly, and her weakness
seemed to fall from her, in passionate
contempt.</p>

<p>“Poor Leola, I cannot blame you,” cried
the triumphant blonde, cheerfully, just as
the door opened again, and Wizard Hermann
glided softly into the room.</p>

<p>“Ah, Leola, you are better. I am very
glad,” he said, in a smooth, oily voice,
taking the chair Jessie vacated, saying she
must go to mamma.</p>

<p>She nodded, wearily, without speaking,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
wishing they would all leave her alone,
for every human face seemed hateful to
her now.</p>

<p>She would not meet his eyes, or she
would have seen that he looked ill and
nervous, too, and that his always furtive,
unpleasant manner had grown more
marked and repellent still.</p>

<p>“Miss Tuttle,” he added, “you may leave
the room. I have private affairs to talk of
with my ward.”</p>

<p>When they were quite alone he turned
back to her, saying, earnestly:</p>

<p>“I have come, Leola, to explain my private
affairs to you, and to make one more
appeal to you to help me out of my
trouble.”</p>

<p>She listened without replying, the deep
somber eyes fixed on the fading sunset
beyond the distant hills, and Wizard Hermann
continued:</p>

<p>“For years I have been heavily in debt,
and had to borrow money from my rich
neighbor, Mr. Bennett, to meet my living
expenses and take care of you, Leola, in
proper style for a pretty young girl. You
have had your governess, your horse, your
clothing, without a care on your young
mind, but I, in order to meet your expenses,
and keep this roof over your head,
have been obliged to place a mortgage of
fifteen thousand dollars on Wheatlands,
and to-morrow the mortgage falls due. If
Bennett forecloses, as he swears he will,
we shall all be turned out homeless.”</p>

<p>It was on her lips to say that she did
not care, that nothing really mattered to
her now, but she bit her lips and held back
the words, waiting silently to the end.</p>

<p>“I have no means of paying my debt; I
cannot possibly raise the money, but neighbor
Bennett has been very generous; he
has offered to forego his pay, to destroy
the mortgage, on one condition. Are you
listening, Leola?”</p>

<p>She nodded, without turning her gaze
from the sunset hills, and he continued,
eagerly:</p>

<p>“I think you know what is coming, Leola.
Bennett has fallen madly in love with you,
and wants you for his wife. If you consent
he will settle a hundred thousand dollars
on you, and forego the debt I owe.
As for the rest, when you are once his
wife, you can wind the foolish old man
around your fingers like a ribbon, and
have your own way in everything. If you
refuse he swears he will turn us all out
of doors in twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>He paused and waited, but she did not
speak, and realizing how futile would be
the attempted exercise of authority, he fell
to pleading:</p>

<p>“Can you let this terrible calamity befall
us, Leola—me in my old age, you in your
youth and beauty? Why, we would not
have whereon to lay our heads if we anger
Giles Bennett.”</p>

<p>The somber dark eyes turned to him,
questioningly:</p>

<p>“I—I—have always supposed that you
held money in trust for me, sir. I did not
dream that I was an expense to you, as
you say,” exclaimed Leola. “Have I then
no friends who can help us in our need?”</p>

<p>“Not one, Leola, for I know nothing of
your relations. To be plain, I took you, a
pauper child, from the almshouse, for pity’s
sake, and have reared you as well as
though you had been my own daughter.
The secret of your birth I kept, and it
shall never pass my lips. But in the hour
of my misfortune I appeal to you to pay
the debt of gratitude you owe me—a debt
that you can only pay by marrying Giles
Bennett to-morrow.”</p>

<p>An icy shudder shook her weak frame;
she felt that death were sweeter than such
a fate.</p>

<p>But the man who had befriended her
young life was waiting with haggard
eyes for her answer—waiting for her to
save him from despair.</p>

<p>And she, the pauper, nameless, homeless,
save for Wizard Hermann’s charity—would
it not be monstrous ingratitude to refuse
his prayer?</p>

<p>She faltered, recklessly:</p>

<p>“I will marry the man!”</p>

<h3>A LITTLE CONSPIRACY.</h3>


<p>When the rash words had passed Leola’s
lips a great trembling seized upon her, a
horror of life she had never felt before,
and she longed to scream out aloud to
him that she must take back her promise—that
she could not bind her beautiful,
throbbing young life to oily, unctuous Giles
Bennett, the man more than twice her age,
and who in no way could be her fitting
mate, not if he paid a million dollars instead
of what he offered.</p>

<p>But when she saw Wizard Hermann’s
radiant face, she dared not utter her passionate
protest against being sold in the
market like a beautiful Circassian slave
to the highest bidder. She feared a fit of
violence, or that he might fall down dead
at her feet of the revulsion of feeling from
relief to disappointment.</p>

<p>She restrained the words that ached in
her throat, and leaned back, helplessly, in
her chair, her eyes half shut, her face
death-white, her senses reeling, and heard,
half-consciously only, the profuse thanks
he was pouring out, and the dazzling picture
he was painting of her future as a
rich man’s wife, even adding, consolingly,
that the fat old man might drop off any
day from apoplexy, and leave her a rich
and happy young widow.</p>

<p>“Go, leave me,” she sighed, faintly, and
he hurried out, nothing loath, to spread the
good news.</p>

<p>The next thing Leola knew she was in
bed again, and Miss Tuttle was reviving
her with cold water on her face mixed
with hot tears that fell from her own eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Tuttle, what are you crying
about?” she sighed, curiously. “Is it true,
then, that he made me—promise to—to”—</p>

<p>“To marry Giles Bennett; is that what
you mean? Yes, he says you promised to
marry that wretch to-morrow. Oh, oh, oh,
this will break my heart!” and poor Miss
Tuttle and Leola, clasped in each other’s
arms, mixed their tears together.</p>

<p>When they grew a little calmer Leola
explained how the promise had been extorted
from her by appeals to her gratitude.</p>

<p>“Oh, do you think it can be true? Am I
only a pauper, taken from the almshouse,
for charity’s sake—perhaps nameless, too?”
she sobbed, bitterly.</p>

<p>Miss Tuttle could give her no comfort,
for although she had been Leola’s governess
from the age of three, she had never
fathomed the mystery about her charge.
But she tried to reassure her, saying:</p>

<p>“Do not brood over it, dear girl, it is
possibly one of old Hermann’s false tales to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
coerce you into obedience. I should sooner
believe that he has appropriated to his
own use money that belonged to you, and
thinks he can make it up to you this way.”</p>

<p>“To live with Giles Bennett as his wife—that
old Falstaff of a man!—I loathe the
prospect!” sobbed Leola.</p>

<p>“While I envy you with all my heart!”
exclaimed the governess. “Oh, Leola, how
strangely fate plays at cross purposes with
human beings! How gladly I would change
places with you and become his wife!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that you could, dear soul!” Leola
answered, and neither one slept that night
for the tumult of their thoughts—Leola’s
all grief and repugnance, Miss Tuttle’s all
envy and wounded love—and when the sunshine
of the July morning peeped into the
windows their faces were haggard and
pain-drawn, and both felt as if the day
of execution had dawned, for Hermann had
told the governess to prepare Leola to be
married at sundown that evening, when
the carriage would be waiting to convey
her at once to her new home.</p>

<p>With heavy eyes they looked into each
other’s faces, wondering how they could
escape their doom, and Leola cried, desperately:</p>

<p>“There is one chance left, and I shall
take it. When I have paid my debt of
gratitude to my guardian by marrying
Giles Bennett, I—I—shall not be among the
living to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“Do you mean it, Leola?”</p>

<p>“I swear it,” answered the girl, recklessly,
and Miss Tuttle knew, by the somber
gaze of the beautiful dark eyes, that it
was true. Life, that had flowed along like
a silvery rippling stream between flower-fringed
banks, had suddenly become a
muddy torrent rushing onward to destruction,
and naught could stay its onward
course. Desperate, reckless, she was ready
to rush unbidden into the Great Beyond,
daring the unknown future in terror of the
awful present.</p>

<p>“Oh, Leola, you must not! It would be a
terrible sin! Promise me you will not!”
cried the poor soul, timorously.</p>

<p>But Leola’s shut lips kept a deadly silence,
and Miss Tuttle continued, conciliatory:</p>

<p>“If you could escape this marriage, Leola,
would you then be willing to live?”</p>

<p>The sudden gleam of hope in the dark
eyes assured her that Leola might yet find
something to live for in her shadowed life,
and she continued:</p>

<p>“Dearie, I have a plan that might help
you. I’ve been turning it over and over in
my mind, but I never should have broached
it had it not been for your dreadful
threat.”</p>

<p>“Tell it to me,” implored the girl, and
glancing cautiously around, that none
might overhear, Miss Tuttle bent and whispered
some rapid words into Leola’s ear.</p>

<p>A light began to dance in the dark eyes,
the pale lips smiled a little, and Leola
cried:</p>

<p>“It will be a terrible risk to run, but if
you can manage it and are not afraid, I
will help all I can, for I long to punish
Giles Bennett for his meanness!”</p>

<p>“I’ll take all the responsibility for everything,”
smiled Miss Tuttle, glowing with
eagerness. “Don’t you worry one bit, Leola;
it will all come right in the end. But,
oh, dear, I’ve got to put in a busy day
getting the bride ready.”</p>

<p>“Make her as pretty as you can, and let
the veil be very thick,” laughed Leola,
with renewed good humor. “And, by-the-way,
Miss Tuttle, you are to tell my
guardian that before the ceremony begins
Giles Bennett must destroy the mortgage
in my presence, or I will not marry him
at all.”</p>

<p>So the busy day began, for the whole
household was in a state of excitement
over the sudden wedding.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stirling and her daughter entered
heartily into the spirit of the affair, and
set the servants to work transforming the
dingy parlor into a floral bower, with wildflowers
and evergreens.</p>

<p>The scheming pair were delighted to think
of getting rid of Leola so easily, hoping
that some fortunate turn of fortune’s fickle
wheel might yet bring back Chester Olyphant
into Jessie’s power.</p>

<p>While they worked downstairs on the
parlor, Miss Tuttle reported herself as very
busy upstairs, getting ready the simple
outfit of the bride, and packing her trunk
for the flitting. Leola would not admit
anybody else inside the door. She said
she was too busy and too nervous.</p>

<p>Inside that locked door there were strange
doings, to be sure.</p>

<p>You would have thought them a pair of
amateur actresses, from the way they went
on.</p>

<p>The governess had dragged down from
the garret a little old trunk containing
some stage properties that had once upon
a time belonged to an actress who had died
while on a visit to Wizard Hermann’s
mother. Her relatives had never taken
away the box, and many a time Leola had
amused herself looking over the queer
things on rainy days when she could not
go out.</p>

<p>She and Miss Tuttle were amusing themselves
again, brushing and combing over
the old wigs, Leola trying on the sedate
brown front, and Miss Tuttle the curly
golden one, that certainly took fifteen years
off her age, after Leola made up her sallow
face with rouge and powder.</p>

<p>Then Miss Tuttle tried on Leola’s best
gown, the dark brown cloth with the silk
waist and loose jacket. The pretty brown
toque was not unbecoming, with the double
veil of white dotted malines, and Leola,
who had never expected to smile again, had
to giggle like a little school girl at the
tout ensemble.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Tuttle, you will make a lovely
bride! I am sorry I shall not have a
handsome gift for you!” she cried.</p>

<p>“You will have given me the desire of my
heart!” cried the governess, so seriously
and gratefully that Leola laughed harder
than ever, thinking she was certainly very
easy to please, since portly Giles Bennett
could fill the measure of her happiness. It
made her think of the old adage Betsy,
the cook, had repeated to her the other
day: “Ever’buddy to deir taste, missie, as
de ole ’oman said when she kissed de
cow.”</p>

<p>However, it was very lucky for Leola that
Miss Tuttle was so infatuated with the rotund
widower that she was willing to win
him by hook or crook, so her laughter
grew more and more joyous as she added,
merrily:</p>

<p>“Be sure that you put a little water in all
the kerosene lamps about the house, so
that they will flicker and grow dim.”</p>

</div>

<h3>SURPRISES ALL AROUND.</h3>


<p>Very dimly, indeed, burned the lamps
among the floral decorations as the family
at Wheatlands gathered in the parlor for
the wedding ceremony, Jessie and her
mother in full evening dress, though Leola
had sent word down that she would be
married simply in her traveling dress.</p>

<p>Outside the gates waited the brand new
carriage, with prancing white horses, that
had brought Giles Bennett and the Methodist
preacher who was to perform the ceremony,
and in the parlor the bridegroom
waited, spick and span in his new black
suit, for his bonny bride. Jessie Stirling,
at the piano, had already begun the first
low notes of the wedding march, and to
that sound came Leola slowly down the
stairs on the arm of Miss Tuttle, having
peremptorily declined her guardian’s escort.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stirling thought it rather ridiculous,
as they came in sight, that that silly old
maid, Miss Tuttle, had chosen to wear a
hat and veil like the bride at the ceremony,
but she did not give the poor, drab-faced
creature a second look, she was so intent
on watching the proceedings.</p>

<p>Wizard Hermann met the pair at the
door, and taking the golden-haired girl by
the arm, led her to the rotund bridegroom
waiting nervously for his happiness.</p>

<p>The minister cleared his throat ready to
proceed, but the bride stood still for a
moment, facing Giles Bennett, and her low
voice said, distinctly:</p>

<p>“The mortgage on Wheatlands—the prize
for which I am sold, sir—have you brought
it as agreed upon?”</p>

<p>He produced a folded paper, and she
beckoned to her guardian.</p>

<p>“Examine this paper. Is it bona fide?”</p>

<p>He answered, huskily:</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>She looked at Giles Bennett.</p>

<p>“You are willing that I destroy this paper,
on condition that I marry you immediately
afterward?”</p>

<p>“I agree to your conditions,” he said, and
directly the fragments of the mortgage
fluttered, like a miniature snowstorm, from
the bride’s white-gloved hands to the floor.</p>

<p>Then she took his arm, and they moved
across to the waiting minister, who began
to pray.</p>

<p>In the excitement no one noticed a rapping
on the open hall door, nor that poor
Miss Tuttle, instead of attending the bride
as maid of honor, had sunk into a low seat
near the door with her handkerchief hiding
her veiled face.</p>

<p>The music played on softly, like a sigh,
the dim lights flickered forlornly among
the fragrant flowers, and the short marriage
ceremony of the Methodist Church
in less than ten minutes made Leola Mead
the bride of Giles Bennett, who had bought
her for her beauty like a slave in the
Circassian market.</p>

<p>And just as he pronounced the pair man
and wife the man who had been knocking
unheard at the hall door strode impatiently
to the parlor and looked within at the unexpected
sight of a wedding party.</p>

<p>He was a middle-aged man of distinguished
appearance, with dark eyes, grizzled
auburn hair and a face bronzed as
from travel. No one saw him as he waited
at the door, while the witnesses crowded
forward with eager congratulations to the
smirking bridegroom and the veiled bride.</p>

<p>Last of all came the one who had been
sitting yonder sobbing in her little lace
handkerchief, and taking first the hand of
Giles Bennett, she exclaimed, earnestly:</p>

<p>“I congratulate you, sir, on winning this
rare prize. She will make you very happy,
I know.”</p>

<p>Then, with a soft laugh that startled
everyone, she threw her arms about the
bride, half-sobbing:</p>

<p>“Dear, dear governess, I hate to give
you up, even to our kind neighbor, Mr.
Bennett, for you have loved him so well, I
know it is for your best happiness to leave
me!”</p>

<p>With a dexterous movement of her hand
she flung off her veil, hat and wig in one
gesture, and stood revealed, beautiful,
golden-haired Leola, masquerading in Miss
Tuttle’s worn and threadbare black silk
gown, a skimpy thing, too short and too
tight, and likely to burst with the peal of
laughter that shrilled over her rosy lips
at their amazed looks.</p>

<p>They all began talking wildly at once,
and staring in wonder at the veiled bride,
who suddenly followed Leola’s example,
and threw off hat, veil and golden wig together,
showing Miss Tuttle’s pretty brown
waves of hair, and her pale, rather frightened
face that turned piteously to her new
made husband as she faltered, weakly:</p>

<p>“I planned this deception to save my dear
Leola, because she vowed that rather than
live with you, after she had paid her
guardian’s debt, she would kill herself this
very night. I couldn’t let her do that,
the poor girl, who hasn’t a friend on earth
but me, and whom I love as if she were
my own child, so, to save her, I carried
out this trick, and I am your wife, sir,
whether you own me or not. But though
I am not as young and pretty as Leola, I
will be a better companion for you, Giles,
than she would ever be, for she fears and
hates you, while I have always respected
you highly ever since I knew you, and will
try to make you a good wife if you will
overlook the little ruse by which I won
you.”</p>

<p>They were all so dazed that no one had
tried to interrupt her, but now Giles Bennett,
turning furiously on Hermann, cried:</p>

<p>“You hound, you let me be tricked into
this fraud, but it shall avail you nothing!
I repudiate this marriage and the whole
transaction. The destruction of that paper
shall not prevent me from getting back my
money from you. The law will protect me
in my rights.”</p>

<p>“I protest I had no hand in this deception.
I meant honestly by you, and to
prove my word I will have nothing more
to do with those women, who have united
in this effort to make you a laughing stock,
and to get me into trouble. They shall
both leave my roof to-night and forever,
Giles, but I beg you will be patient with
me and grant me a little more time before
you bring suit to recover your money,”
began Hermann, abjectly, when a ringing
voice cried, “Hold!” and the unobserved
stranger at the door strode, uninvited, into
the room, adding:</p>

<p>“Ah, Henry Hermann, you know me. I
have come at last for my daughter, Leola,
and it seems I have unearthed some villainy
on your part. Will some one tell me
the meaning of all this excitement?”</p>

<p>Leola flew to him with a cry of joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>“My father, oh, my father! You have
come at last!”</p>

<p>The bronzed stranger clasped her to his
heart and kissed her beautiful lips again
and again, exclaiming:</p>

<p>“Sweet image of your lovely mother,
now an angel in heaven, we shall never
be parted again! But now tell me the
meaning of this strange scene.”</p>

<p>Clinging fondly to his arm the girl answered,
spiritedly:</p>

<p>“That old Falstaff there held a mortgage
on my guardian’s estate for fifteen thousand
dollars, and offered to cancel it if I
would become his wife. So I was persecuted
into giving him my promise, and to
save me from despair and suicide my dear
governess planned to deceive them and put
herself in my place.”</p>

<p>“But it won’t do any good,” blustered
the angry Bennett, “I won’t take the old
girl on any terms, and I’ll have my money
out of Hermann all right, and that soon!”</p>

<p>He recoiled in surprise at the stranger’s
contemptuous laugh.</p>

<p>“Your mortgage is not worth the paper
it was written on, for I hold a prior one
that Hermann executed to me over thirty
years ago, for thirty thousand dollars, as
much as the full value of his estate. This
money he had from me before my Leola
was born, because I admired his scientific
attainment and wished to make him independent,
so that he could prosecute his
experiments in chemistry. At my dear
wife’s death I went abroad with an exploring
party to drown my grief. As Hermann’s
mother was a kinswoman of mine,
I left Leola with him, giving him ten thousand
dollars for taking care of her, but it
seems that he has betrayed his trust, and
but for this noble governess here my poor
girl would have been betrayed into a
wretched marriage. I have no more use
for so unworthy a guardian, but I shall
not take revenge by foreclosing my mortgage
on his home. I shall leave him in
peaceable possession the term of his life;
then Wheatlands will revert to my daughter,
Leola. For the rest, as soon as Leola
can pack up to leave I shall take my dear
girl away with me to New York, and if
Mr. Bennett repudiates his pretty bride,
she may accompany us. I am rich, and for
her love and care of Leola she shall be
well repaid.”</p>

<p>The bride and groom looked at each
other, she pitifully humble and entreating,
he angry and resentful, yet on a sudden
inclined to make the best of what seemed
to him a bad bargain, so that he muttered,
ungraciously: “You may come home with
me, Amanda.”</p>

</div>

<h3>WIDOW GRAY AND THE YOUNG CAVE-HUNTERS.</h3>


<p>The tender-hearted Mrs. Gray returned
to her cottage after her repulse at Wheatlands
in a very sad state of mind over
Chester Olyphant’s strange disappearance.</p>

<p>In the month that he had boarded with
her she had grown to appreciate him very
highly for his true manliness and noble
character, and, on his part, her esteem
had been returned by a frank, out-spoken
regard.</p>

<p>Toward the last he had made her his
confidant, telling her his true name and
position, and explaining why he had wooed
Leola under a mask for the sake of romance,
wishing to be loved for himself
alone.</p>

<p>“My life has been sad in many ways in
spite of great wealth,” he said. “My parents
died in my early childhood, and I was
brought up by an uncle and aunt who are
all now dead, so that I have really no near
relatives, having been an only child. But
now I shall arrange to marry Leola very
soon, and my beautiful home on the Hudson,
Bonnie View, will have a fitting mistress
in my lovely bride. As for you, my
dear friend, in return for all your kindness,
I want you to come to us when we are
married and make your home at Bonnie
View as Leola’s companion.”</p>

<p>He was disappointed when she declined,
gently but decidedly, to accept his offer,
and when he pressed for a reason the good
woman said, simply:</p>

<p>“I cannot leave the little cottage where I
came a bride, for the sweetest memories
of life cluster around this humble spot.
Here my two sweet children, my boy and
girl, were born, and here they and my
husband passed away from me to the Better
Land. Here they return in spirit to
brood over my lonely life in love and
sympathy, and if I went away perhaps
they could not find me easily, or perhaps
they would not be as well pleased as here,
where we were all so happy together.
When my earthly life is ended they will
come to soothe my last hours and bear me
company to my heavenly home, so I must
wait for them here, where they watch over
me daily, and I am happier so than anywhere
else.”</p>

<p>Her words sounded strange to Chester
Olyphant in the glow of his love and
youth, loving the world and its gay companionship,
but he read on her placid
features a peace and resignation he could
not understand, and ceased to urge her to
change her home, only stipulating that he
and Leola should at least have a long
visit from her at Bonnie View, to which
she cheerfully assented.</p>

<p>So now, at his strange absence, her heart
sank with dread, for last night at her
window the wind in the pine tree had
sobbed like ghastly voices, and she remembered
that it had sounded just so before
each calamity that had darkened her
life, vaguely foretelling sorrow.</p>

<p>“Something bad has surely happened to
the poor young man, for he would never
have gone away like this with no explanation,”
she sighed, as she went, restlessly,
about her household duties, with a heart
as heavy as lead.</p>

<p>On the next afternoon she took her knitting
out on the front porch watching,
eagerly, up and down the road, for a sight
of the absentee, but all in vain.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard childish voices, and
saw four little lads coming in at her front
gate—little fair-haired, blue-eyed boys,
“stairsteps,” she called them—their ages
ranging from eight to twelve.</p>

<p>Widow Gray knew all these neighbor
boys very well, and had often entertained
them on her front door-step with apples
and ginger-bread cookies, for they were
adventurous little fellows, brothers and
cousins, who often stole away from their
homes to explore little caves roundabout,
leaving their doting mammas in wild
panics over their absence.</p>

<p>The good woman knew that another expedition
was on foot, for each boy carried
a new tallow candle in hand, and wore his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
worst clothes, as if on purpose, while their
pretty faces looked up at her, engagingly,
as George, the youngest and boldest, acting
as spokesman, asked:</p>

<p>“Mis’ Gray, please, ma’am, may we explore
the cave that opens from the hill in
your back lot?”</p>

<p>Smiling cheerily at them, she answered,
kindly:</p>

<p>“Bless your little hearts, there ain’t no
cave there, children. My husband always
told me ’twas the end of an underground
passage from Wheatlands, where the Hermanns
used to hide in Indian raids.”</p>

<p>“We’d like to see it, all the same, ma’am,
please,” said the blue-eyed boy with the
little pug nose, in that sweet coaxing voice
that always won its way with every one.</p>

<p>At that she frankly gave consent, since
she could see no possible danger in the
adventure, but as she handed them out
some currant buns for lunch she shook her
head at them slyly, saying:</p>

<p>“I wonder if your mas know you are
out on this raid?”</p>

<p>“Oh, they don’t care!” fibbed Willie, with
a jaunty air, and then they all went around
the house, disappearing presently in the
hole under the hill, with their lighted
candles, the four dearest and happiest little
chaps in Christendom.</p>

<p>“Bless their little hearts,” she sighed,
wiping the quick tears from her eyes as
she thought of her own two darlings at
rest in the little green mounds over in
the Presbyterian graveyard, under the
grass and flowers, and as she knit and
rocked the summer wind seemed like tender
childish fingers playing with the locks of
white hair on her wrinkled brow.</p>

<p>So time slipped away for an hour or so,
as she sat there in the summer stillness,
lulled by the hum of bees and the song
of birds, and the low breeze sighing in
the pine trees, and then she started up at
the sound of excited voices coming around
the house.</p>

<p>The four cave-hunters were returning
helter-skelter, their faces pale, their eyes
like saucers, all shouting at once:</p>

<p>“Oh, Mis’ Gray, we have found a dead
man!”</p>

<p>“A dead man!”</p>

<p>“A dead man!”</p>

<p>“If you don’t believe us, come on, and
we will show you!”</p>

<p>It was no boyish joke, she could see
from their pale, earnest little faces, so she
said:</p>

<p>“Oh, my, how dreadful! Some Indian
bones, perhaps, my dears?”</p>

<p>The boys, who had got in a close group
together, now began to talk in loud whispers,
one saying. “Oh, tell her!” another,
“Oh, don’t,” while the something unexplainable
in their faces made her tremble
with a strange dread.</p>

<p>She said as calmly as she could for the
wild beating of her heart:</p>

<p>“Out with it, boys; tell me all you know
at once!”</p>

<p>Thereupon Georgie shouted, glibly:</p>

<p>“We went about five miles in the cave
with our candles, an’ then we found”—</p>

<p>She held up a remonstrating hand, saying:</p>

<p>“Not five miles, oh, no; I have often
heard that the underground road isn’t more
than a mile.”</p>

<p>“Well, a mile, then,” continued George,
unabashed, “an’ then we thought we heard
an nawful grunt, an’ we all jumped so
that our candles most went out, an’ the
skin creeped on our bones, ’cause we
thought it might be an Indian ghost, you
see, an’ we might get tommy-hawked, an’
our mammas wouldn’t never know where
we was, ’cause we sneaked away,” he broke
down, with a stifled whimper, and nudged
the next boy to go on.</p>

<p>Alex took up the story, adding:</p>

<p>“The little boys was scared, but we
wasn’t, an’ we marched right on, an’
d’reckly we come on a dead man—not Indian
bones, no, but a white man with his
head all bloody, an’—an’—then we thought
we better come back for you, ’cause you
know him.”</p>

<p>With a groan she cried:</p>

<p>“You don’t mean my boarder—Mr. Chester!”</p>

<p>Perhaps the little fellows had already
decided to break the news to her gently,
for they nudged each other, and the oldest
one said, sorrowfully:</p>

<p>“It looked like him, but maybe ’tain’t.
Please come with us and see!”</p>

<p>“I will come,” she said, “but wait; you
said he groaned.”</p>

<p>“Before we got to him it sounded like
groans, but when we found him he was dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead as a door nail!” sobbed little
Laurie, awesomely, while the eyes of the
smallest one brimmed over with tears.</p>

<p>It needed no more to make the excited
woman follow their guidance back to the
cave, as they persisted in calling it, taking
with her some water and a bottle of wine.</p>

<p>She soon found that the little boys had
told her the truth.</p>

<p>The body of Chester Olyphant lay seemingly
lifeless on the ground, the brown
curls matted with blood from a wound on
the side of the head.</p>

<p>“Oh, who has done this awful murder?”
she moaned, as she listened at his heart
for a throb of life.</p>

<p>It seemed to her there was a faint, irregular
beat, and she hastened to apply
her restoratives, eliciting a low sound like
a gasp or sigh.</p>

<p>“Oh, boys, we’ll have to carry him out
to the air,” she exclaimed, and by their
valiant efforts they got him out of the passage
just as twilight darkened the world.</p>

<h3>“TIME DOES NOT STOP FOR TEARS.”</h3>


<p>While the wedding was going on at Wheatlands
that evening, Doctor Barnes, hastily summoned to
the cottage, was sewing up a ghastly cut on Chester
Olyphant’s head, and explaining to Widow Gray
that it had barely escaped being a fracture of the
skull. Even now he could not tell what the outcome
would be, for, though life still lingered, there
was no return to consciousness.</p>

<p>He made the four little heroes very proud and
happy by telling them that God himself must have
prompted their expedition that day in order to save
the young man’s life, and they scampered off home
in great excitement, to spread the news of their
wonderful adventure.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the doctor sent for the best nurse in
town, and installed her at the cottage to aid Mrs.
Gray in caring for the patient.</p>

<p>But when Leola Mead and her father were driven
down to the station that night, to take the midnight
train for New York, no hint of the truth
reached them, and Leola’s heartache over her lover’s
falsity was destined to last long, for from
that hour, when she had fallen like one dead in
the arbor, no news of him transpired for many
months. Too proud to confess her heart wound
to her father, she never called that once loved
name in his hearing; she only sought refuge from
her pain in change of scene, saying to him eagerly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“Papa, darling, I have been buried in the country
so long that I am wild to see the world. If
you are able to gratify my desires, I prefer travel
to anything else on earth.”</p>

<p>“I live only to gratify your wishes now, my
precious daughter,” answered Alston Mead, eager
to atone for having neglected her so long in his
passionate grief over the loss of his lovely young
wife.</p>

<p>He had planned to come back and settle down in
a quiet home with his lovely daughter, but he
found it no hardship to gratify her desire for
travel, since wandering had become a second nature
with him.</p>

<p>So in their leisurely wanderings through the
United States, and afterward abroad, the past
became almost like a dream to Leola, who told
herself, bitterly, that doubtless Jessie Stirling and
Olyphant were married long ago, and that she did
not care, for she hated him now as much as she
had once loved him.</p>

<p>Alston Mead, in all ignorance of the tragic love
story of his fair daughter, wondered a little that
she remained so indifferent to the suitors she attracted
wherever she went, for to him it seemed
very natural for a young girl to fall in love; still
he rejoiced that she did not appear to be susceptible,
saying to himself that he could keep her all
the longer to himself.</p>

<p>But all the time Leola was thinking with bitter
pique and pain of Jessie and Chester reconciled
and happy, perhaps long ago wedded, his love affair
of that golden summer an almost forgotten
episode.</p>

<p>It was bitter, for Leola knew in her heart that
she had given the best and truest love of her life,
and that she could never know again the bliss of
those fleeting days, when she had loved and trusted
as she never could again, because her tenderness
had been betrayed, her heart trampled on like a
withered flower thrown into the dust.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Like the wild hyacinth flower, which on the hills is found,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Which the passing feet of the triflers forever tear and wound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Until the purple blossom is trodden in the ground.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>So strangely and completely had Leola’s life
changed that sometimes she felt as if she had died
and come to life again in some new world—a
kaleidoscopic world of change, in which every face
and scene was new—if only, she said to herself,
bitterly, she had not brought with her into this
new life the cruel memories of the past, that
seemed always crying aloud to her heart:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Look in my face; my name is Might-have-been;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">I am also called No-more, Too-late, Farewell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Unto thine ear I hold the dead-sea shell.</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Cast up thy Life’s foam-fretted feet between;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Unto thine eyes the glass where that is seen</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Which had Life’s form and Love, but by my spell</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Is now a shaken shadow intolerable.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But “time does not stop for tears,” and the days
and months rolled away and brought round golden
June again, so that it was a year since Leola had
ridden out so joyfully on Rex to meet her fate in
Chester Olyphant’s dark blue eyes.</p>

<p>They were in Paris now, and everyone knows
how charming Paris is in June, but somehow
Leola’s thoughts turned backward to the West Virginia
hills that she had vowed she never cared to
see again—turned back with a strange homesickness
to the wild and picturesque scenes where her
joyous youth had been nurtured, to the old faces,
the old pleasures, and she thought that she should
like to get on Rex’s back again for a breezy canter
into the country town, or on to the old Blue Sulphur
Spring for a draught of its cold, clear, sparkling
water.</p>

<p>She could close her eyes and see just how it was
looking, after the long, cold winter, in its new
summer gown of green, trimmed with violets, blue
and white—that dear old hillside back of the house;
and the orchard would be decked in pink and
white, and the birds would be singing like mad in
the branches, and the sky would be blue and
sunny, and the sweet air seem like an elixir of
life.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes, and she was in Paris again,
and she had in her hand a memorandum for the
shopping she was going to do that week—gowns
and laces and jewels, to deck that wonderful beauty,
to set off, like a splendid frame, the peerless
form, the flowerlike face, with its somber dark
eyes and thick waves of ruddy golden hair—the
Titian shade artists raved over.</p>

<p>Her father had had her portrait painted—full
length, and all in white—and all Paris had raved
over it when the artist had it on exhibition those
few days before it was boxed to be shipped to
America. She had made many friends, been entertained
at the homes of the rich and great, had
refused dazzling offers to the wonder of all, and
here she was, all at once, with a fit of nostalgia
for the simple home and kindly faces that were
gone out of her life forever—or so she thought.</p>

<p>She had often thought of the new Mrs. Bennett,
wondering if her simple devotion had ever won
her rotund husband’s heart, but she had never
written her a line in her eagerness to forget the
grief over those last days, and put them behind her
forever.</p>

<p>Now she thought, tenderly, of the good woman,
murmuring:</p>

<p>“How strange it seems I have never heard one
word from all I left behind! Some of them may
be dead, some married—Jessie and Chester, of
course, long ago—but there are few I care for save
my dear old governess and Mrs. Gray!”</p>

<p>Putting all these thoughts behind her with a
passing wonder why they had come like ghosts from
a dead past to disturb her present peace, she rang
for her maid and got ready for her shopping tour.</p>

<p>An hour later she knew why those subtle memories
had overwhelmed her this morning. It was
the influence of telepathy.</p>

<p>Turning over some rare silks at the Arcade, her
heart leaped, and her blood turned cold in her
veins at the sound of a familiar voice:</p>

<p>“Leola Mead, am I dreaming, or is it really
you? What a charming surprise! Why, only this
morning I was thinking of you, wondering where
you were; and to find you here so soon, it’s like a
dream!”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My foe undreamed of by my side</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Stood suddenly like fate—</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To those who love, the world is wide,</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">But not to those who hate!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Leola felt a small, gloved hand pressing hers
very hard, looked into bluebell eyes under flaxen
waves of hair, and turned cold with dislike and
repulsion, dreading every moment to see over the
blonde’s shoulder her husband’s face, handsome and
winning, with the laughing blue eyes that had
smiled her heart away.</p>

<p>With a strong effort she pulled herself together,
calling her passionate pride to her aid. They
should not see her wince; she would show them
she had forgotten him. She said, coldly:</p>

<p>“So it is you, Jessie Stirling? How long have
you been over?”</p>

<p>“Oh, since early spring shopping for my trousseau,
you know,” twittered Jessie, gayly.</p>

<p>“Then you are not married yet?” Leola cried,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“No; but I shall be soon—in late July. Chester
was ill so long, you know,” she twittered on; then,
at the startled look in Leola’s dark eyes, “Oh, I
forgot you went away so abruptly that night before
everything happened—the explosion and all!
Tell me, haven’t you ever heard from home? from
any of them? Not a word, you say? How very
strange! Leola, is your carriage waiting? Yes?
Then I will go for a drive with you, and tell you
everything. We can come back for our shopping
later”—dragging her out.</p>

<h3>“IF HATE COULD KILL.”</h3>


<p>The two fair young girls stepped into the elegant
equipage, and as it rolled down the glittering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
boulevard in the glorious sunshine, they were the
cynosure of all eyes.</p>

<p>Jessie Stirling began excitedly:</p>

<p>“And so you have never heard a word from
West Virginia since the night you left so suddenly!
Then I have much to tell you. But first, have you
not heard from Chester Olyphant in all this time?”</p>

<p>There was an anxious tone in her voice, but
Leola did not heed it, she answered so spiritedly:</p>

<p>“That is a strange question, Jessie. I have not
heard, or ever wished to hear, from him.”</p>

<p>Jessie’s little tinkling laugh rang out in shallow
ripples on the air, as she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Still angry! But, poor dear, I do not blame
you. It was hard for me to forgive him for trifling
with your tender heart. It was his illness and suffering
that melted my heart.”</p>

<p>Leola listened in blank silence. She would not
have asked one word about Chester Olyphant if
Jessie had said that he was dead.</p>

<p>“You care nothing for him now—that is plain
to be seen. I am glad you have gotten so bravely
over it,” said Jessie, smiling at the fair, proud
face, with the somber dark eyes gazing straight
ahead, though seeing nothing of the gay streets
with throngs of happy people going up and down
as they drove on behind the liveried coachmen.</p>

<p>Then she added:</p>

<p>“You remember, we thought that Chester Olyphant
had run away after I betrayed him? That
was wrong.”</p>

<p>She knew that Leola was listening, though she
did not answer a word.</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, I may have been a little to
blame, Leola, for, in anger at Chester’s duplicity,
I ran to Uncle Hermann with my story, and he
was angry—fearfully angry—at the wrong done to
me and to you. At first he swore he would horse-whip
him, but mamma begged him not to create a
public sensation, for she said it was best to let
it blow over. Uncle Hermann did not say yea or
nay, and we thought he was pacified.”</p>

<p>She drew a long breath, and continued:</p>

<p>“Well, you remember how everything happened
that night—the wedding, your father’s return to
take you away, and everything? When the Bennetts
were gone, also you and your father, Uncle
Hermann was desperate. We sat up late talking
over matters, holding, as it were, a council of war;
for, though your father had mercifully permitted
him a life-time use of Wheatlands, he was so involved
in debt that he could not see a dollar in
sight anywhere.”</p>

<p>Leola made no comment, and the speaker went
on:</p>

<p>“Uncle Hermann wanted to borrow of mamma,
saying he was prosecuting an experiment that
must, if it succeeded, make him fabulously rich,
and revolutionize the whole world. But chemical
ingredients were costly, and he could not go on a
week longer without money. He had borrowed,
begged, got all he could, and was desperate for
more funds. He said he could almost steal, if he
knew where to lay his hands on the money, for
the sake of his great experiment. He even went
on his knees to mamma, but alas! it was ‘like
going to the goat’s house for wool.’ Mamma had
pawned her diamonds long before to keep afloat in
society, and was desperate for means herself. So
she could not help him at all, and she said she
would go home next day so as not to bother him
any longer in his trouble. We retired, and at
breakfast next morning he said he and Joslyn would
be busy in the laboratory until afternoon; that he
had a few chemicals to work on yet; and that, before
we left, we might have to congratulate him
on the success of his experiment.”</p>

<p>Leola began to look more interested. She could
not help being sorry for Wizard Hermann and the
failure of his pet hobbies—the ambitions of a toilsome
lifetime.</p>

<p>Jessie Stirling continued:</p>

<p>“Mamma and I went upstairs and packed our
trunks, and telephoned to town for a man to take
them down to the station. When they were gone
we walked out to the arbor, waiting for luncheon,
and to bid good-bye to my uncle, when—oh, Leola,
with a shock!—suddenly there was the sound of a
terrific explosion from the tower, and we fell back
almost stunned in our seats. It almost seemed as
if the world were coming to an end, for one loud
report followed another, and the tower was blown
away, with all of the chimneys. Then suddenly all
grew still, and fire shot out of the windows and
doors, caused by an explosion of gasoline Uncle
Hermann had been using in his experiments.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how terrible!” cried Leola, finding voice at
last.</p>

<p>“Yes, was it not?” cried Jessie, growing excited
at the memory, and adding: “For not only was
the house burned to the ground, but Joslyn, uncle’s
servant, was killed; while as for himself, he fought
his way bravely from the burning building, saving
his life at the expense of all that made it worth
living—his eyesight destroyed, his arms burned off
to the elbows.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how horrible! how horrible!” groaned
Leola, and her lovely face went deathly white with
the shock of the story.</p>

<p>“I knew you would be shocked,” exclaimed Jessie.
“Oh, wasn’t it fortunate for us that we had
gotten out of the house just before! And saved
our trunks, too! The cook was out in the garden
getting peas for dinner, luckily for her! Joslyn
was burned in the house; and as for Uncle Hermann,
we thought he must die, too. Indeed, he
thought so himself, for he was in horrible agony,
so he sent for a priest—he was a Catholic, you
know—and confessed his sins.”</p>

<p>“And he lived, after all? What became of
him? Who took care of the poor man?” cried
Leola, with tears in her eyes, forgetting her own
wrongs in exquisite sympathy.</p>

<p>“Why, the Bennetts took him to their house and
cared for him till he recovered; and he lives there
yet, having a man attend to him all the time. I
must say Mrs. Bennett acted beautifully to Uncle
Hermann, and has befriended him all this time in
spite of the fact that he hadn’t been as good as
he might to her when she was a lone old maid.”</p>

<p>“It was just like dear Miss Tuttle to return
good for evil! She had a noble heart!” cried
Leola. “Dear soul, she was too good for Giles
Bennett!”</p>

<p>“Mamma says she has made a better man of
him, and he has become really fond of the kind
soul. You see, mamma made a trip there this
spring as Mrs. Bennett’s guest, while I came over
to Europe with a friend,” added Jessie, who would
have bitten her tongue off before she would have
owned to Leola that, having exhausted all their
means and failed to catch a rich husband, she had
been forced to become the paid companion of a
rich woman, while her mother eked out an existence
“visiting around.”</p>

<p>She would fool Leola, and keep her and Chester
Olyphant apart as long as she could; but she had
an unerring conviction that Fate in the long run
would bring them together.</p>

<p>After a moment’s hesitation she began again:</p>

<p>“I told you that Uncle Hermann confessed his
sins the day he thought he was going to die, but
you do not seem curious over it, so I’ll tell you
all about it anyway. Uncle Hermann was so furious
over Chester Olyphant’s trifling with you and
me that on the day when you lay unconscious upstairs
he met Chester in the hall and struck him
on the head with a blunt iron instrument, so that
he fell like one dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead!” cried Leola, and she shook with emotion.</p>

<p>“Uncle Hermann did not mean to kill him, but
he and Joslyn, who happened along at the moment,
both thought he was dead, and, to hide the
crime, they dragged him into the library, took up
the flooring, and dropped him down into an underground
passage the family had used in Indian
times. So on his disappearance we naturally concluded
he had run away to avoid my reproaches,
don’t you see?”</p>

<p>Leola could only gasp, without speaking, so
great was her emotion; and Jessie, enjoying the
sensation she was creating, again took up the thread
of her story:</p>

<p>“So that was what Uncle Hermann had to confess
when he thought he was dying. It was the
only really wicked thing he ever did, and he
wanted to get God’s forgiveness before he died;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
likewise, he wanted Chester Olyphant to have a
Christian burial. Poor Leola, you are faint! All
this has been too much for you.”</p>

<p>Leola faltered, through stiff, white lips:</p>

<p>“No, no; go on, if there is any more to tell.”</p>

<p>Jessie laughed, and resumed:</p>

<p>“I have kept the best for the last. Just as the
men were going to hunt for Chester’s body in the
underground passage, Doctor Barnes came along
and told them that some little boys had found him
alive in the cave, as they called it, and they had
taken him to Mrs. Gray’s cottage. Well, to make
a long story short, Chester had an awful wound
on his head, and a piece of the skull pressed on
the brain, and he never recovered health or consciousness
till he was taken North for an operation
that made him all right again. Mrs. Gray
was like a mother to him through it all, and, next
to mamma and me, I suppose he considers her his
dearest friend. Now, as to our love affair, we
made it all up some time ago, and are to be married
in July; but I suppose there’s no use asking
you to be my bridesmaid, dear Leola?”</p>

<p>“No,” the girl answered, curtly, adding:</p>

<p>“Jessie, I promised papa to meet him at luncheon,
and I shall hardly get back in time if we do not
return now. May I invite you to join us?”</p>

<p>“Not to-day, thank you, Leola, but I will call
on you soon, for I am anxious to see you again,
and also to meet your papa. Now if you will be
so kind as to drive by Lady De Vere’s, where I
am staying with my New York friend, I will be
very grateful.”</p>

<p>Leola assented, and presently Jessie was set
down at the place she wished, and blew Leola a
deceitful kiss from her finger tips as she went in,
muttering to herself as she watched her drive
away:</p>

<p>“It was a gratuitous fib I told her about marrying
Chester Olyphant, but I couldn’t resist stabbing
her once more to see the light grow dim in
the beautiful eyes that stole his heart from me.
All my maneuvering has failed to win him back,
and her turn will soon come, for he is here in
Paris, although she does not know it, and at any
minute they may meet, and everything be explained.
Oh, how I wish hate could kill!”</p>

<h3>LIKE A STAR IN THE NIGHT OF HER
DESPAIR.</h3>


<p>At the luncheon, which was served in their private
dining-room, Leola could scarcely touch a
morsel, she was so eager to tell her father all that
she had heard that morning, barring, of course, the
facts about Chester Olyphant, whose name she
vowed should never pass her lips.</p>

<p>But she had scarcely begun her story when he
smiled and interrupted:</p>

<p>“It seems quite a coincidence that we have both
met people from the United States this morning—ghosts,
as it were, out of your past life.”</p>

<p>“Why, papa?”</p>

<p>“Yes, people from West Virginia, dear—old
neighbors of yours—and from them I have heard
already all you were going to tell me.”</p>

<p>“Neighbors of mine! Why, papa, dear, you
cannot mean—the Bennetts?”</p>

<p>“Why not, my dear?”</p>

<p>“Why not, indeed? They are rich enough to
travel, and I remember now that my governess
used to hanker after foreign travel. So she is
here? You have seen her? Dear soul, I must call
at once.”</p>

<p>“She will be here herself by-and-by, so you have
only to wait and rest till she comes.”</p>

<p>“I shall be very impatient,” declared Leola, and
then she laughed:</p>

<p>“I suppose Giles Bennett has forgiven me the
trick I played him by now?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he said so with very hearty emphasis,
and I believed him. Indeed, the man appeared
proud of his wife, who seems to dote on him. They
have been touring the continent for several months,
and I met them in an art gallery this morning. I
confess I should hardly have known them again,
they were both so improved since that night, but
Mrs. Bennett recognized my face, and ran joyfully
to me to ask about you. So we talked for an hour,
and I invited them to call at our hotel this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I can hardly wait for them to come, I am so
anxious,” declared the girl, joyfully. “Are you
sure that you have told me everything, papa?”</p>

<p>“Did I mention that Wizard Hermann was dead?”</p>

<p>“No, papa.”</p>

<p>“Well, that is one of the things they told me.
It happened quite suddenly, the cause being heart
failure, so after that they decided on this tour.
They have with them also some one else that you
know—a Mrs. Gray, who had a present made her
of this tour by a gentleman whom she had nursed
through an illness. How strange you look, Leola!
You have grown pale, and you tremble. Are you
ill?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, papa—perhaps just a little nervous.
Go on, papa, have you anything more to tell?”</p>

<p>“Not just now, my dear daughter—not till you
take your luncheon. No? A drop of this wine,
perhaps, to set you up. There, the color is coming
back to your cheeks. Shall I ring to have the
things taken away?”</p>

<p>She nodded, and they adjourned to their private
parlor.</p>

<p>Then Alston Mead said, gently:</p>

<p>“My dear daughter, I have been hearing surprising
things about you to-day. While I have been
wondering at your indifference to men, it seems
you already had a lover.”</p>

<p>Her cheeks paled, then flamed.</p>

<p>“Who has dared betray that unhappy episode of
my past? Who has called his despicable name?”
she half-sobbed.</p>

<p>Alston Mead put his arm about her tenderly, like
a woman, with a soothing caress.</p>

<p>“Gently, dear; perhaps he does not deserve your
scorn,” he said.</p>

<p>“Then you do not know all the story, papa.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I know it better than you do, my darling
girl, and, strange to say, Chester Olyphant
has been known to me for years. His father and
mother were dear friends of mine, and I knew
their boy when he was a little curly-headed chap
in kilts. Naturally, I lost sight of him afterward
in my exile.”</p>

<p>Leola cried, bitterly:</p>

<p>“You lost sight of him, so you did not know he
grew up to be an unworthy scion of a good family—a
heartless trifler with women’s hearts.”</p>

<p>“Grave charges, my daughter!”</p>

<p>“You said that you knew all, dear papa.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have heard both sides of the story, and
you know only one, Leola.”</p>

<p>“Papa!”</p>

<p>“You know only one,” he repeated.</p>

<p>Leola cried, passionately:</p>

<p>“That was all there was to know! And I am
sorry, I am indignant, that my friends, in mistaken
kindness, have betrayed this to you. I—I—was
forgetting it in this new life with you—only it
came back bitterly this morning when Jessie told
me—that—she—will be married to him—in July!”</p>

<p>“And you, Leola, did you hear that news without
a pang? Has your heart grown callous?”</p>

<p>“Spare me, papa!” and the golden head was
buried on his breast, while heaving sobs shook his
daughter’s form from head to feet—sobs that seemed
to burst her very heart in twain.</p>

<p>Had her heart grown callous? Oh, no, the pity
of it, that she could not deny she had given her
love, irrevocably, to another woman’s lover—to one
unworthy her lightest thought.</p>

</div>

<p>Alston Mead let her head rest in his arms until
the storm of tears spent itself naturally; then, as
she began to grow calmer, he exclaimed, angrily:</p>

<p>“Curses on the woman whose malice has culminated
in this past year of sorrow; whose memory
must always darken your life, even when the
shadow shall be removed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“Removed, papa? Alas, alas!” moaned the girl,
who could see in the future no surcease of sorrow.</p>

<p>She started when her father laughed aloud:</p>

<p>“My dearest, how little faith you had in your
lover, to believe all that little cat told you out of
spite!”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa, you do not understand. Indeed, he
was her lover. Jessie spoke the truth. He—only—sought—to
amuse himself with me. I—I—know
that it is true, for—I—saw—her—in—his arms!”</p>

<p>He could hardly bear the anguish in the great,
dark eyes, the shame, the self-pity in the quivering
voice: he must tell her the truth; he could not see
her suffer any more, poor, proud Leola!</p>

<p>So he answered, quickly:</p>

<p>“You saw her spring to his arms, my dear; and
if you had not fainted at the sight, you would
have seen her the next moment repulsed with scorn
by the man who despised the shallow little deceiver.”</p>

<p>A wild cry of incredulous hope shrilled over her
lips, and his words came like a star in the night
of her despair.</p>

<p>He continued, tenderly:</p>

<p>“You were tricked and deceived, my poor Leola,
by two designing women. Granted that Chester
Olyphant had once been engaged to marry Jessie
Stirling, he had found her out and broken with
her before he came to the mountains to seek you.
The girl lied to you, deceived you wickedly, scheming
to separate you and win him back herself. You
fainted, and then Fate stepped in and aided Miss
Stirling to keep you deceived for a whole year, but
that was all, for he continued to repulse all her
efforts to get him back. His only fault toward
you, darling, was his hiding his name and position,
in the natural, romantic desire to be loved for himself
alone!”</p>

<h3>“ALL THE WORLD AND WE TWO, AND
HEAVEN BE OUR STAY.”</h3>


<p>Alston Mead had never fully recognized before all
the rare beauty of Leola, for until now it had
been shadowed by her secret sorrow—the thorn that
was always piercing her heart.</p>

<p>When the girl looked up at him now her eyes
were like stars, sudden roses had bloomed on her
cheeks, and her lips were trembling with smiles of
joy.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is like some sweet dream!” she cried,
half fearfully, her white hands clasped above her
wildly throbbing heart.</p>

<p>“It is no dream, my darling; it is a blissful reality,”
her father cried. “Your lover has always
been true and noble, and worthy of your deepest
devotion. For months he has been seeking for you
everywhere, and our fortunate rencontre this morning
has filled his heart with joy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa! you have then seen Ray—Chester, I
mean!” she began, in wild agitation, but he interrupted
her, smilingly:</p>

<p>“Call him Ray if you choose, dear—his name is
Raphael Chester Olyphant, you see. Yes, your true
lover is in Paris to-day. He crossed with your
friends to seek for you. He will be here by-and-by
to see you, but I promised to tell you everything
first, for he does not know whether you will forgive
him for deceiving you under the guise of the
poor artist.”</p>

<p>She cried, radiantly:</p>

<p>“I am glad of it now, for he knows I loved him
for himself alone, and he can never doubt my devotion.
Oh, I can scarcely realize my happiness!
It seems like some beautiful dream.”</p>

<p>They were interrupted by the entrance of the
Bennetts with Mrs. Gray, and such happy greetings
were never seen before.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bennett, grown matronly and stylish,
hugged and kissed her dear pupil until she was
quite out of breath.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gray followed suit when she got a chance,
and Giles Bennett squeezed her little hand until her
fingers ached.</p>

<p>Then every one told Leola she was lovelier than
ever, and it was easy for her to return the compliment,
for prosperity and happiness had worked a
vast improvement in all three.</p>

<p>A great chattering ensued, all trying to talk at
once; for, said Mrs. Bennett, roguishly:</p>

<p>“We must talk as fast as we can, for some one
else is coming presently, and he warned us that
when he appeared he wanted to have the field all
to himself.”</p>

<p>How Leola’s heart beat! how her cheeks burned!
She stole a glance at herself in the long, gilded
mirror, wondering if he would think her as pretty,
in her costly silk gown and fine laces, as in the
simple cotton gown of the rustic maiden. The
mirror assured her she was even more charming
now, for it is not to be disputed that “fine feathers
make fine birds.”</p>

<p>They told her all over again the story Jessie had
related that morning, adding some that she had
preferred not to tell.</p>

<p>The Stirlings had done their best to lure Chester
Olyphant back, but all in vain; and losing their
last dollar, the girl had found employment as companion
to a rich old woman going abroad, and the
mother eked out existence visiting around among
friends of her better days. Jessie had sent a last
appeal to Chester the day before, and he had answered
it with silent scorn.</p>

<p>Suddenly their talk was interrupted by the entrance
of a servant carrying a card to Mr. Mead.</p>

<p>He glanced at it, and then passed it, with a
smile, to his daughter.</p>

<p>The visitors took the hint, and rose precipitately.</p>

<p>“We must all try to meet again to-morrow,”
Mrs. Bennett said, as they all filed out, escorted by
Mr. Mead, leaving a clear field for Leola’s lover.</p>

<p>The happy girl sank back in her chair, feeling
as if her heart would burst with its wild throbbing.</p>

<p>People had died from shock of joy as well as of
grief. Could she survive it?</p>

<p>Her face went pale for a moment—pale as a
snowdrift, and she closed her lovely eyes with a
gasp.</p>

<p>There was a quick step in the room, a hurried
breath, and some one knelt at her feet, and caught
her two hands in a rapturous clasp that sent the
warm blood bounding through her heart again,
crimsoning her cheeks and lighting her eyes like
stars as she opened them to meet those dark-blue
orbs that in the long ago had lured the girlish
heart from her breast, and taught her the most exquisite
lesson of life, with its blended joy and pain.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“And all the wondrous things of love</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">That sing so sweet in song</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Were in the look that met in their eyes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And the look was deep and long.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For a long time that mute yet speaking gaze was
enough without words, but at last Chester rose and
drew her to his heart.</p>

<p>“Sweetheart!” he cried, and their lips met after
that long year of silence and sorrow and pain—Jessie
Stirling’s year of revenge for all she had lost
by her own unworthiness.</p>

<p>“I could die now!” Leola murmured, faintly, as
she clung to his breast.</p>

<p>“No, you must live for me, my bonny bride!” he
answered, and presently they were seated, hand in
hand, going over the past.</p>

<p>When she told him of her meeting with Jessie
that morning, and of all she had said, Chester
turned coaxingly to his lovely sweetheart.</p>

<p>“So she will have me married in July, willy-nilly!”
he said. “Well, then, why disappoint her
plans, my darling? We can be married just as well
as not in July, if you will only consent.”</p>

<p>“Why, July is only two weeks off, Ray!”</p>

<p>“Well, we can make it the last of July, you
know, dear—it is so easy to get a trousseau here
in Paris, don’t you know? Say yes, Leola, do,”
he pleaded.</p>

<p>“We must ask papa first, you know,” she said.</p>

<p>“Papa will never stand in the way of our happiness,”
he cried, eagerly.</p>

<p>“But, Ray, he will be so lonely.”</p>

<p>“No, dear, for he must come to Bonnie View
and live with us, so he will only gain a son instead
of losing a daughter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>Alston Mead was easily brought to take Chester’s
view of the case, the more easily because he had
in his heart a secret he would never confide to any.</p>

<p>In the last few years an incurable disease of the
heart had fastened upon him, and the most eminent
physicians had told him he had not much
longer to live, even if he settled down to quiet
days for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>It had pained him to think of leaving beautiful
Leola alone in the world, heiress to his wealth,
perhaps to become the prey of designing fortune-hunters.</p>

<p>Now all that tangle would be straightened out
by her speedy marriage.</p>

<p>He gave consent gladly to all that Chester Olyphant
proposed, and he said to himself:</p>

<p>“Now, whether I die in a few months or live
long enough to name my first grandchild, I shall
pass away in peace, knowing that Leola’s heart can
rest safely in her husband’s love.”</p>

<p>So Chester had his way, to the delight of all,
and the invitations went out soon for the wedding
at the grand cathedral, for Chester wanted all the
world to see his peerless bride.</p>

<p>Most especially did he wish Jessie Stirling to be
present, so in the invitation that went to her was
a note from the happy groom-to-be:</p>

<p>“My Dear Miss Stirling: As you saved me the
trouble of setting my wedding day by naming it for
July, Leola and I will insure your reputation as a
prophet by accepting the date.”</p>

<p>When Jessie read that note, with Chester Olyphant’s
name signed to it, she tore it to tatters
in her fury, but that did not prevent her from
showing the elegant invitation to her employer, and
saying, hesitatingly:</p>

<p>“I was once engaged to young Olyphant myself,
but his love grew cold when my fortunes failed,
and I willingly released him.”</p>

<p>Lady De Vere only smiled, for she had heard
from one of Jessie’s former friends the story of
Jessie’s engagement, broken through her own fault
long before she was reduced to poverty, so she only
thought: “That girl is the most consummate liar I
ever knew.”</p>

<p>A bitter curiosity carried Jessie to the wedding,
but she wore a thick veil, for she did not want to
be recognized. When she wrote to her mother
afterward about it, she confessed that Chester and
Leola made the handsomest bridal couple she ever
saw, but that in her humiliation she had one comfort
left—though she could not win him back, she
had succeeded in separating him from his sweetheart
for one terrible year, whose pain and anguish
neither could ever forget.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
